\textbf{Types of radioactive decay.} Radioactivity is a phenomenon of spontaneous decay of atomic nucleus in which one or several particles are emitted. Nucleus which undergoes such a decay is called radionuclide. A radioactive decay is possible if it is allowed by the law of conservation of energy (although this is not a sufficient condition for the decay): the mass of a parent nuclide must exceed the net mass of the decay products, i.e. a daughter nuclide and particles emitted. There is a large number of naturally occurring radionuclides which either survived from the moment of their production or are continuously generated by cosmic rays. At the same time radionuclides can be artificially produced by bombarding stable nuclides with energetic particles. There is no difference between natural and artificial radioactivity.

A radioactive decay is specified by time constant, particles emitted, and by angular correlation of the emitted particles (if there are several). A primary radionuclide is called a parent nuclide, and the product of its decay a daughter nuclide. Radioactive decays include $\alpha\text{-}$ and $\beta\text{-}$decays (including $K$-capture), $\gamma$-radiation, nuclear fission, and emission of delayed neutrons and protons. Two last processes belong to the type of two-step process because emission of a delayed neutron (proton) follows the preceding emission of an electron (positron) almost immediately. Therefore the nucleon emission is delayed by the time constant of the preceding $\beta\text{-}$decay. Now consider these processes in some detail. \vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Alpha-decay.} A spontaneous $\alpha\text{-}$decay can happen only for a heavy nucleus with a charge of $Z>83$ and for a small group of rare earth elements with atomic numbers of $A=140\div160$. The half-life of $\alpha\text{-}$active nuclei obeys the Geiger-Nuttall law which can be easily obtained from the quantum-mechanical description of this decay process.

Four nucleons composing an $\alpha\text{-}$particle (two protons and two neutrons) participate in a complicated motion of nucleons in the nuclide and there is no way to distinguish these four particles from the rest. However there is a small probability ($\Simeq10^{-6}$) of $\alpha\text{-}$particle formation for a short period as a result of these four nucleons random converging inside the nuclide. Only when the $\alpha\text{-}$particle leaves the nuclide and becomes separated it can be considered as a distinct particle. 

According to the law of conservation of energy $\alpha\text{-}$decay is allowed if the binding energy of parent nuclide $E_{A, Z}$ is less than the sum of binding energies\Footnotemark \Footnotetext{Binding energy is the energy required to split the nucleus into its constituents, protons and neutrons. If the binding energies of nuclei are known, one can calculate the energy balance of any nuclear decay and a mutual transformation process.}of daughter nuclide, $E_{A-4, Z-2}$, and $\alpha\text{-}$particle, $E_{\alpha}$, 
$$   \Delta E=E_{A-4, Z-2}+E_{\alpha}-E_{A, Z}>0. \eqMark{4_1}
$$

The binding energy of $\alpha\text{-}$particle equals $28\;\MeV$, which is \linebreak \hbox{$7\;\MeV/${nucleon}}. Therefore $\alpha\text{-}$decay is not allowed for medium nuclei which binding energy per nucleon is $\Simeq8\;\MeV$.

Consider the potential energy of $\alpha\text{-}$particle inside a nucleus and in the nearby region (see~\refFigure{4_1}). The short-range nuclear force rapidly vanishes outside the nucleus\fFigure{Potential energy of $\alpha\text{-}$particle versus its distance from the nucleus center, $E$~is the kinetic energy of $\alpha\text{-}$particle emitted. The potential inside nucleus is taken to be equal to $\alpha\text{-}$particle energy near the nucleus surface at the moment of emission; dashed line is the Coulomb energy near the surface}4_1 {5.7cm}{3.1cm}{pic/L04_01.eps}, so the $\alpha\text{-}$particle is subjected only to the force of electrostatic repulsion which potential energy is 
$$   U=\frac{2(Z-2)e^2}{r}.   \eqMark{4_2}
$$

A strong attraction due to nuclear forces takes over at the nucleus boundary and the potential energy curve plummets. Inside the nucleus the potential can be taken approximately constant. According to classical physics, even if the potential energy of $\alpha\text{-}$particle inside the nucleus is positive, so that $\alpha\text{-}$decay is allowed by the law of conservation of energy, classically the decay cannot proceed without supplying the $\alpha\text{-}$particle with an additional energy required to overcome the potential barrier (see~\refFigure{4_1}). However, quantum mechanics allows transmission, or \textit{tunneling} of $\alpha\text{-}$particle through the potential barrier. This can happen because particle behavior in quantum mechanics is described by wave function $\psi$ which modulus squared $|\psi(r)|^2$ is proportional to the probability of particle detection at the point $\textbf{r}$. In the case of potential barrier of finite height, the $\psi$-function is non-zero everywhere. Therefore there is a small probability to detect the particle outside the nucleus, which implies that $\alpha\text{-}$decay is possible.

The transmission coefficient $D$ of a potential barrier for $\alpha\text{-}$particle with energy $E$ is 
\vspace{-8pt}
$$
\ln D=-\frac{2}{\hbar}\int\limits_{R\sub{n}}^{R\sub{t}}\sqrt{2m_{\alpha}(U-E)}\,dr.   \eqMark{4_3}
$$

\vspace{-4pt}
Here the integration limits are the barrier boundary and the boundary of the region where the kinetic energy becomes (formally) negative, i.e. the nuclide radius $R\sub{n}$ and the classical turning point $R\sub{t}$ determined by the condition $E=2(z-r)e^2/R\sub{t}$ (see~\refFigure{4_1}). The term <<turning point>> means that the particle is reflected from the barrier at this point providing its motion is described by classical mechanics.

A case of practical interest obeys a strong inequality $E\ll U(R\sub{n})$, i.e. the tunneling occurs deeply under the potential barrier. Since the Planck constant is small the contribution of the region where $U\Simeq E$ is also small, so one can take $E\ll U$ everywhere. Under these conditions the transmission coefficient given by Eq.~ (\refEquation{4_3}) becomes

\vspace{-16pt}
\begin{Multline}
\ln D\Simeq\frac{2\sqrt{2m_\alpha}}{\hbar}\int\limits_{R\sub{n}}^{R\sub{t}}\sqrt{\frac{2(Z-2)e^2}{r}}\,dr =-\const\cdot\int\limits_{R\sub{n}}^{R\sub{t}}\frac{dr}{\sqrt{r}}\Simeq\\   \Simeq-(A\sqrt{R\sub{t}}-B)=-A\left(\frac{B}{\sqrt{E}}+C\right),
\eqMark{4_4}
\end{Multline}%
where $A$, $B$, and $C$~are some constants. Since the half-life $T_{1/2}$ is inversely proportional to the transmission coefficient, Eq.~(\refEquation{4_4}) results in the experimentally verified Geiger-Nuttall law
$$
\lg T_{1/2}=\frac{a}{\sqrt{E}}+b,   \eqMark{4_5}
$$
which relates the nuclide half-life with the energy of emitted $\alpha\text{-}$particle. If $T_{1/2}$ is measured in seconds and $E$ in MeV, the coefficients $a$ and $b$ become
$$
a\Simeq1{,}6Z;~~~b\Simeq-1{,}6Z^{2/3}-21{,}4.   \eqMark{4_6}
$$
Since only heavy nuclides ($Z>83$) undergo $\alpha\text{-}$decay, the quantity $\Delta Z/Z$ does not significantly vary for different nuclides. Therefore, according to Eqs.~(\refEquation{4_5}) and~(\refEquation{4_6}), $T_{1/2}$ weakly depends on the charge of nucleus $Z$, does not depend on the mass number, and strongly depends on the energy of emitted $\alpha\text{-}$particle. Up to this point we discussed the transmission coefficient of potential barrier, i.e. the probability of $\alpha\text{-}$particle tunneling through the barrier when the particle comes close to the nucleus surface. In order to find the decay constant $\lambda$ the transmission coefficient must be multiplied by the frequency $\nu$ of collisions of the particle and the surface,
$$   \lambda=\frac{\ln 2}{T_{1/2}}=\nu D.   \eqMark{4_7}
$$

A crude estimate of $\nu$ in Eq.~(\refEquation{4_7}) is given by 
$$   \nu=\frac{v}{2R\sub{ÿ}},   \eqMark{4_8}
$$ 
where $v\Simeq\hbar/(m_\alpha R\sub{n})$~is the $\alpha\text{-}$particle velocity inside the nucleus. 

Of course, $\alpha\text{-}$decay can be accompanied by a change of the nucleus angular momentum. The diagram in~\refFigure{4_2} illustrates how this could happen. Since \fFigure{\mbox{$\alpha\text{-}$particle} leaving nucleus with non-zero angular momentum }4_2 {3.9cm}{3cm}{pic/L04_02.eps} the $\alpha\text{-}$particle has a tangential velocity component $v_t$, then according to the law of angular momentum conservation, the nucleus receives the momentum $L=m_\alpha v_t r$ and the rotational energy $L^2/(2m_\alpha r^2)$. Due to large mass of the nucleus its recoil energy can be neglected and the law of conservation of energy reads:
$$   E=\frac{m_\alpha v^2}{2}+\frac{L^2}{2m_\alpha r^2}+U(r).   \eqMark{4_9}
$$ 
One can see that the energy acquires a new term which can be considered as a centrifugal potential energy. This increases the barrier for $\alpha\text{-}$particle and hence the half-life. The corresponding increment is specified by a quantity
$$   \eta =\frac{\text{centrifugal barrier}}{\text{Coulomb barrier}}=\frac{l(l+1)\hbar^2}{2m_{\alpha} 2(Z-2) e^2r}.   \eqMark{4_10}
$$

The square of angular momentum in Eq.~(\refEquation{4_10}), $L^2 = l(l+1) \hbar^2$, is written in quantum form; here $l\hbar$ is the maximal projection of~$\textbf{L}$ on any axis.

The radius of nucleus with $Z=90$ is approximately $10^{-12}\;\cm$, which gives
$$   \eta \Simeq 0{.}002\,l(l+1).   \eqMark{4_11}
$$ 
This estimate shows that the centrifugal barrier can be significant only for large $l$, i.e. for  essentially non-central emission of $\alpha\text{-}$particle.

\textbf{Beta-decay}. Beta-decay is a process of spontaneous transformation of unstable nuclide into an isobar (a nucleus with the same number of nucleons, i.e. the same mass number $A$) which charge differs from the primary charge by $\Delta Z=\pm 1$ due to emission of electron (positron) or capture of electron from atomic shell. The main feature of $\beta\text{-}$decay is that it proceeds via weak interaction (rather than via electromagnetic or strong one). The corresponding probability is approximately $10^{14}$ less than the probability of a process governed by strong interaction, so the half-lives of $\beta\text{-}$active nuclei are usually large, from several minutes to hours. A beta-decay always occurs when it is allowed by the conservation laws. The Coulomb barrier for $\beta\text{-}$decay is not essential due to the small mass of electron.

A typical feature of $\beta\text{-}$decay is the energy spectrum of emitted electrons (see~\refFigure{4_3}). Unlike~$\alpha\text{-}$particles, the electrons emitted in \mbox{$\beta\text{-}$decay} form a continuous energy spectrum. This happens because the electron emission is accompanied by emission of another particle, neutrino, with zero rest energy. Due to statistical nature of the decay its full energy is randomly shared between the electron and the neutrino, i.e. the electron energy can take any value from zero to the decay full energy.

Let us consider $\beta\text{-}$decay from the energy viewpoint. Consider an atom with a charge ${Z+1}$. Let its full energy be $E_{Z+1}$ and the zero energy correspond to the energy of a singly ionized atom and a free electron. This implies that the energy of a neutral atom with the charge $Z+1$ is negative and is of the same order as the ionization energy of atom (see~\refFigure{4_4}).

\textit{In the case A} the energy $E_Z$ of atom with the charge $Z$ is higher than $E_{Z+1}$. The process allowed by energy conservation is $\beta\text{-}$decay in which the atom emits electron and becomes ionized since the number of protons after the decay is $Z+1$ and the number of electrons is $Z$, so it is a singly ionized atom $Z+1$. The process $E_{Z+1}\rightarrow E_Z$ corresponding to positron emission is energetically forbidden. 

\textit{In the case B} ($0<E_{Z+1}-E_Z<2mc^2$) the transition $E_{Z+1}\rightarrow E_Z$ is allowed only when the nucleus~$Z+1$ captures an electron from atomic $K$, $L$, or $M$-shell. Usually a nucleus captures $K$-electron, so the process is named $K$-capture. A new atom $Z$ is produced in excited state $B^{*}$ corresponding to a hole~\cFigure{Energy diagram of $\beta\text{-}$decay}4_4 {8.3cm}{10.1cm}{pic/L04_04.eps} in $K$ or $L$-shell. Then transition to the ground state follows, which is accompanied by emission of characteristic $X$-rays:  
$$   B^{*}\rightarrow B+h\nu.   \eqMark{4_12}
$$

\textit{In the case C} the energy of atom $Z$ is such that $E_Z+2mc^2<E_{Z+1}$. In this case $K$-capture is also possible. In addition the nucleus can undergo $\beta^{+}$(positron)-decay. It is not difficult to derive the above energy relation. If $m$ is the electron (positron) mass, $M_Z$ is the mass of parent nuclide, and $M_{Z+1}$ is the mass of daughter nuclide, then 
$$
M_{Z+1}c^{2}\geqslant M_{Z} c^{2} + mc^{2}.   \eqMark{4_13}
$$
But masses of atoms $Z$ and $Z+1$ (with masses of their electrons taken into account) are
$$
^{A}\!M_{Z}=M_{Z}+Zm, \quad ^{A}\!M_{Z+1}=M_{Z+1}+(Z+1)m.   \eqMark{4_14}
$$
Substituting these equations into Eq.~(\refEquation{4_13}) we obtain
$$
^{A}\!M_{Z+1}\geqslant {}^{A}\!M_{Z}+2m   \eqMark{4_15}
$$
or
$$
E_{Z+1}\geqslant E_{Z}+2mc^2.   \eqMark{4_16}
$$

It should be emphasized that $\beta\text{-}$decay is actually a nucleonic process. A single nucleon, neutron or proton, decays inside a nucleus. Electronic decay is related to the decay of neutron:
$$
n^{0} \rightarrow p^{+} +e^{-} + \widetilde\nu.   \eqMark{4_17}
$$

In the case of positronic decay a proton decays inside a nucleus: 
$$   p^{+} \rightarrow n^{0}+e^{+} + \nu.   \eqMark{4_18}
$$ 
Notice that a free neutron is unstable, its half-life is $10{.}5\;\mi$. A free proton does not decay since its mass is less than the mass of neutron, but a proton inside a nucleus is able to decay since the required energy can be supplied by the nucleus. \vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Gamma-radiation}. When a nucleus has an excessive energy but emission of a nucleon is not energetically allowed, the energy is emitted in the form of $\gamma\text{-}$quantum, the name used for quantum of electromagnetic field emitted by nuclei (its energy is usually greater than $100\;$\keV). Emission of $\gamma\text{-}$quanta with the energy exceeding the binding energy of nucleon occurs only when nucleon emission is forbidden by parity and angular momentum conservation, in this case $\gamma\text{-}$quantum emission is more probable.

Gamma-radiation of nuclei is due to interaction of individual nucleons with electromagnetic field. However, unlike $\beta\text{-}$decay, $\gamma$-quantum emission is a nuclear process rather than a nucleonic one. An isolated free nucleon cannot emit (absorb) a $\gamma$-quantum without violating the laws of energy and momentum conservation. (Compare the impossibility of photoelectric effect on free electrons.) But a nucleon inside a nucleus can emit the quantum by sharing its momentum with other nucleons.  

Since the photon mass is zero, a photon cannot be specified by orbital angular momentum, instead the concept of multipole radiation is used. It is often said that photon spin is $1$, although this should not be literally understood. Firstly, the concept of spin is not applicable to a massless particle, i.e. one cannot define an intrinsic angular momentum in the reference frame related to the particle. Photon is always in motion at the speed of light, so according to special relativity there is no frame in which it is at rest. Secondly, although the total angular momentum of photon, as it is shown below, can be arbitrary, only dipole quanta with momentum $L=1$ are emitted in optical transitions, for this reason the photon momentum is taken to be $1$. 
%translator note: the last sentence is wrong. 

A multipole of electromagnetic field is a state of the freely propagating field specified by angular momentum and parity. A state with momentum $L$ and parity $(-1)^{L}$ is called electric $2^{L}$-pole (usually symbol $E$ is used), and a state with momentum $L$ and parity $(-1)^{L+1}$ is called magnetic $2^{L}$-pole (the symbol \mbox{$M$}). The lowest multipole states have special names: dipole ($L=1$), quadrupole ($L=2$), and octupole ($L=3$). Monopole ($L=0$) $\gamma\text{-}$quanta do not exist because an electromagnetic wave is transversal (such a wave cannot be spherically symmetric, the field lines must point at a certain direction).

As a rule, $\gamma\text{-}$quantum in the lowest possible multipole state is emitted. Increasing the multipole order by unity decreases the probability of $\gamma$-quantum emission by the factor of $(\lambdabar/R)^2$, where $R$~is the nucleus radius and $\lambdabar=\lambda/(2\pi)$ is the reduced wavelength of $\gamma$-quantum. Probability of emission of magnetic quantum is also $(\lambdabar/R)^2$ less than that of electric quantum of the same multipole. Thus, organizing the transitions by decreasing probability one obtains: $E1$, $E2$ and $M1$, $E3$ and $M2$, etc.

W.\,Heitler showed that $2^L$ photon has the angular momentum $L$; according to quantum mechanics its absolute value is $\sqrt{L(L+1)}$, as for a particle of finite mass. According to the law of angular momentum conservation there must exist the following relation between angular momenta $I\sub{i}$ and $I\sub{f}$ of the initial and final states of nucleus and the angular momentum $L$ carried away by $\gamma\text{-}$quantum:
$$   |I\sub{i}-I\sub{f}|\leqslant L \leqslant I\sub{i}+I\sub{f}.   \eqMark{4_19}
$$

This is the selection rule constraining the angular momenta. According to the rule a dipole $\gamma\text{-}$quantum ($L=1$) can be emitted only in transition between the states with $\Delta I=0,\;\pm 1$, except ($0$--$0$)-transitions; quadrupole $\gamma\text{-}$quantum ($L=2$)~in transitions between the states with $\Delta I= \pm 2, \;\pm 1,\; 0$, except ($0$--$0$), ($0$--$1$)-, and ($1$--$0$)-transitions, etc.

Another selection rule is imposed by the law of parity conservation. The wave function parity is related to the change of sign of the wave function under inversion of all three coordinate axes. For a static dipole the inversion interchanges positions of the charges (see \refFigure{4_5}). Thus, in the initial frame the inversion is identical to changing the sign of all charges. However, for a magnetic dipole (loop current) the same inversion does not reverse the direction of current of the dipole.

Therefore the allowed parity change of a nuclide emitting electric $L$-pole $\gamma$-quantum is given by
$$   \frac{P\sub{i}}{P\sub{f}}=(-1)^L,   \eqMark{4_20}
$$ 
while for a nuclide emitting a magnetic $L$-pole radiation
$$   \frac{P\sub{i}}{P\sub{f}}=(-1)^{L+1},   \eqMark{4_21}
$$ 
where $P\sub{i}$ and $P\sub{f}$~are the parities of initial and final states of the nucleus.

Often a nucleus goes from an excited to the ground state not directly but via emission of a cascade  of $\gamma\text{-}$quanta of less multipole momenta. \fFigure{Different behavior of vectors $\textbf{p}$ and $\textbf{j}$, corresponding to electric and magnetic dipole under mirror reflection}4_5 {5.3cm}{1.7cm}{pic/L04_05.eps} In this case there is an angular correlation between the successively emitted $\gamma\text{-}$quanta, i.e. the second quantum is emitted in a preferred direction.

The angular correlation can be explained as follows. A projection $m$ of the total angular momentum of \mbox{$\gamma$-quantum} on its momentum can only be $m=\pm 1$ (in the units of the Planck constant $\hbar$). The value $m=0$ is excluded since electromagnetic wave is transversal. Now, if a nucleus in a state with zero angular momentum emits a $\gamma$-quantum in a certain direction, the nucleus spin in the lower energy state can have a projection $\pm1$ only on this direction, the zero projection is not allowed. Therefore, the nucleus spatial orientation is not completely random and the cascade $\gamma\text{-}$quanta are emitted in different directions with various probability. The angular correlation significantly depends on angular momenta of the cascade states.

Usually the lifetime of a $\gamma$-active nuclide is small, of the order of $10^{-11}\div10^{-7}\;\s$. Occasionally, if the transition energy is small and the low multipole transitions are forbidden, the life-time of a $\gamma$-active nuclide can be several hours or even years. Such excited long-lived nuclear states are called isomers. The phenomenon was discovered in $1935$ by I.~Kurchatov with collaborators. An isomeric state must have a low excitation energy and a spin which significantly differs from spins of lower energy states. Usually an isomeric state is the first excited state of a nuclide. For instance, the ground state of nuclide $_{49}^{115}\mathrm{In}$ has spin and parity $9/2^{+}$ and the first excited state $1/2^{-}$ has the energy of $335\;\keV$. The transition is so forbidden that the half-life of the excited state turns out to be $14{.}4\;\cha$. A more striking example is provided by the nuclide $_{73}^{180}\mathrm{Ta}$ which ground state spin and parity are $1^+$ while the first excited state $9^-$ has the energy of $75\;\keV$; the isomer half-life is $10^{15}\;\text{years}$.
%
Notice that all laboratory sources of $\gamma\text{-}$rays are actually long-lived $\beta\text{-}$active nuclides which produce $\gamma$-quanta when the parent nuclide decays into excited states of daughter nuclides. For example, a common source of $\gamma$-rays, $_{27}^{60}\mathrm{Co}$ ($T_{1/2}=5{.}3\;\text{years}$), emits electrons with energy of $0{.}3\;\MeV$ followed by $\gamma$-transitions (of the daughter nuclide $_{28}^{60}\mathrm{Ni}$) with energies $1{.}17$ and $1{.}33\;\MeV$.

Besides $\gamma$-radiation there is another mechanism of energy loss by excited nucleus, the emission of internally converted electrons. In this process the excitation energy is directly transferred to an atomic electron which receives the total energy of the excitation. $K$-electrons are converted with maximal probability since their wave functions overlap the nucleus most of all. However if the energy released in the nuclear transition is less than the binding energy of a $K$-electron, the internal conversion proceeds on $L$-electrons, etc. In addition to converted electrons the internal conversion is accompanied by $X$-rays 
%
\cFigure{Beta-spectrum of mercury nuclide $^{203}_{~80}$Hg}4_6 {8.8cm}{4.8cm}{pic/L04_06.eps}
%
emitted when electron from an external atomic shell fills the hole in a $K$- or $L$-shell left by the ejected electron. Internally converted electrons are monoenergetic which allows one to distinguish them from $\beta\text{-}$electrons which spectrum is continuous. The diagram in~\refFigure{4_6} shows the spectrum of electrons emitted by a $\beta\text{-}$active mercury nuclide.

The beta-decay proceeds from the ground state of $_{~80}^{203}\mathrm{Hg}$ to an excited state
of $_{~81}^{203}\mathrm{Tl}$, the latter goes to the ground state by emitting a $E2$ or $M1$ $\gamma$-quantum with the energy of~$279\;\keV$. The transition is strongly converted, so the continuous energy spectrum of $\beta\text{-}$electrons is superimposed with monoenergetic lines.

It should be emphasized that internal conversion is a primary interaction process between $\gamma$-rays and atomic electrons; in other words it proceeds via virtual, rather than real quanta. This is the main distinction between internal conversion and the photoelectric effect.

 \vspace{8pt} \textbf{Nuclear radiation dosimetry and radiation safety.} This section provides a brief introduction to interaction processes between nuclear radiation and the living tissue of human body together with the basics of nuclear radiation dosimetry. All students working in the nuclear laboratory must read this section carefully, learn the basic experimental procedures, and know how to handle a dosimeter.
 
All living organisms are exposed to natural radiation due to cosmic rays and radionuclides of the Earth crust. In addition, the development of nuclear science and technology brings a danger of exposure to radiation doses which significantly exceed the natural background.

Methods of nuclear research are based on the usage of radiation sources, such as accelerators, nuclear reactors, and artificial radionuclides. The sources used in the nuclear laboratory are alpha-, beta-, and gamma-active nuclides. The sources are well shielded, so exposure to radiation is reduced to minimum and the laboratory experiments pose no health hazard.

Nevertheless, nuclear radiation is dangerous and whoever works with it must understand how it affects human organism. Nuclear particles ($gamma$-quanta, electrons, neutrons, protons, and alpha-particles) can easily destroy atoms and molecules inside living cells of our bodies, and the affected cells perish. On the other hand, about $10$ million cells of a human body die every second anyway, so the destruction caused by radiation exposure should not be a matter of concern. However, the radiation damage of a living cell could be critical because the cell contains chromosomes with DNA strands carrying the information on how to build new cells.

Nature takes care of eliminating, at least, partially the consequences of radiation exposure of a living cell by means of certain regeneration mechanisms. Harmed cells are repaired with special enzyme systems which quickly restore the damaged DNA molecules. Various morphological and biochemical effects caused by a moderate exposure to radiation can be reduced if the dose is split into several small portions separated by sufficient time periods.

Nevertheless, it should be clear that if the damage is done on the stage of cell division, the genetic code can be altered, which results in mutation. A mutation is not necessarily harmful. For instance, if it happens in a gamete (reproductive cell) this is evolution. But mutations can also cause cancer, the most serious risk factor of a small radiation dose. It should be noted that mutations occur in human body at a steady rate, in particular, due to natural radioactivity and mostly due to natural and artificial chemicals, carcinogens. The most common carcinogen is tobacco smoke. 

Since radiation mostly affects the dividing cells, those parts of our body where the cell division proceeds at the fastest pace are the most vulnerable. First of all, these are hematopoietic organs (bone marrow, spleen, and lymphatic glands), epithelium of gonads and intestinal mucosa. Less vulnerable are the limbs. A human organism is more vulnerable when it is young and growing and, of course, inside the womb. 

The table below lists units of radioactivity and radiation doses introduced for quantitative estimation of radioactive sources and their radiation. 

Roentgen ($\rentgen$)~is the unit of exposure dose; like rem (roentgen equivalent in man) it is not a system unit but it is still widely used. The dose of $1\;\rentgen$ produces the charge of $1 \;\text{CGS units}= 2{.}58\cdot 10^{-7}\;\Kl$ per $1\;\kg$ in $1\;\cm^3$ of dry air. Therefore the number of ion pairs $n$ produced in air by the dose of $1\;\rentgen$ is
$$   n=\frac{1\;\text{CGS}_q}{4{.}8\cdot 10^{-10}\;\text{CGS}_q}=\frac{10^{10}}{4{.}8}\Simeq 2\cdot 10^9.
$$

The unit of equivalent dose of ionizing radiation of $1\;$rem corresponds to the exposure of a living organism to the dose of radiation that produces the same biological effect as $1\;\rentgen$ of $\gamma$-radiation. The unit rad is the abbreviation of~\textit{radiation absorbed dose}. The unit of $1\;\rad$corresponds to the radiation energy of $100\;\erg$ absorbed by $1\;\g$ of matter, i.e. $1\;\rad = 100\;\erg/\g$. The radiation dose of $1\;$grey is equivalent to the energy release in living tissue of $1\;\Dj/\kg$.

A particular effect of radiation on organism depends on the number of particles, their type and  energy. For this reason it is convenient to use sievert as a measure of radiation dose. These units are related via the factor $K$, the relative biological radiation efficiency:
$$
D[\text{Sv}]=D[\text{Gy}]\cdot K.   \eqMark{1}
$$

\vspace{-2pt}
For instance, for $X$-rays, gamma-, and beta-radiation ${K=1}$, for protons with energy less than $10\;\MeV$ and neutrons with energy \mbox{$0{.}1\div10\;\MeV$} it is $10$, and for alpha-radiation with energy less than $10\;\MeV$, it is $20$.\looseness=-1

All modern dosimeters, the instruments for measuring exposure to ionizing radiation, measure a  particle flux in sieverts or roentgens. Notice that $1\;\text{Sv}$~is a very large dose. A typical dose  in dosimetery is one millisievert. It is approximately equal to the annual dose due to the natural background radiation.

The principal question is what are the chances that a given radiation will be harmful for man? At present  the answer to this question can be precise only for large doses. The probability that a dose of about one sievert will be lethal, in millisieverts is approximately equal
$$   P \Simeq 10^{-5}D.   \eqMark{2}
$$

One can see that the probability depends linearly on the exposure. For low dose it is very difficult to separate the effect due to radiation from other environmental factors.

At the same time there is an indirect method of estimating the radiation hazard. It is quite natural to assume that the radiation effect on human body is proportional to the number of damaged genes

which can be directly determined with a good accuracy by counting the damaged genes for a large pool of cells. The diagram in~\refFigure{4_7} represents combined results of a large number of such studies.

Solid lines correspond to statistical boundaries of the functional dependence of the number of damaged chromosome on radiation exposure. Although the statistical scatter is large, three characteristic regions can be identified. For the annual dose of $0{.}2\div2\;$Gy (region $C$) the chromosome damage is approximately proportional to the dose squared. In the region $B$ (a small annual dose from $2\cdot 10^{-3}$ to $0{.}2\;$Gy) the percentage of damaged genes remains almost constant. On the one hand, this could be due to a mechanism of gene disruption which is different from radiation. On the other hand, this could be due to gene repair, the process that has been already mentioned. Using the data the allowed radiation dose is chosen in the middle of the $B$ region, i.e. where the gene damage is independent of the dose.

Annual radiation dose received by a human consists of the following contributions (in millisieverts):

This quantity determines the maximal annual dose of radiation exposure for a person who does not  work with radiation. In our country the maximal dose for the population is $1\;$mSv per year (in addition to natural background radiation) for any consecutive $5$ years but no more than $5\;$mSv per year. It is interesting that people living at the sea level receive the effective equivalent dose about $300\;$$\mu$Sv per year ($0{.}03\;\text{$\mu$Sv}/\cha$) due to cosmic rays. People living higher than $2000\;\m$ above the sea level receive a dose about $0{.}1\;\text{$\mu$Sv}/\cha$. The radiation flux due to cosmic rays increases $25$-fold between altitudes of $4000\;\m$ (this is the maximal altitude where human settlements exist, the sherpa villages on Everest) and $12000\;\m$ (the maximal altitude of transcontinental passenger flights), from $0{.}2\;\mkZv/\cha$ to $5\;\mkZv/\cha$. Therefore an average dose received by a passenger flying from Europe to America is about $50\;\mkZv$.

Before doing experiments in the nuclear physics laboratory one must learn how to measure radiation doses. For this purpose a dosimeter ÀÍÐÈ-$01$-$02$ <<Ñîñíà>> is used. The instrument is designed to detect a flux of $\gamma$-quanta with energies $0{.}06 \div 1{.}25\;\MeV$ (the range of exposure dose is $0{.}01\div9{.}99\;\mrentgen/\cha$) and a flux of $\beta\text{-}$particles in the range of \mbox{$10\div5000\;\text{particle}/\cm^2\cdot\mi$.} The sensitive element of the dosimeter is a gaseous ionization detector. 

\vspace{-0.5pt}
The dosimeter operates as follows. An electric power converter increases the battery voltage ($9\;\V$) to $400\;\V$, the voltage is then applied to the ionization detector. An ionizing particle passing through the detector volume causes an electrical breakdown resulting in a voltage pulse across the electrodes, the pulse is then amplified by an electronic circuit. The number of detected pulses is shown on the digital display. When the dosimeter is set to the <<MD>> position, the internal timer interrupts the pulse count after a definite time period. The period duration is chosen so that the display figure corresponds to the dose of exposure to $\gamma$-radiation in mR/hr. If the switch is set to the <<T>> position the duration of the count period is set by user.

For convenience the dosimeter operating in <<ÌÄ>> mode emits a sound at the end of a count period. In the <<T>> mode a short sound is emitted after registering every ten pulses.

Before a measurement one should always check the dosimeter. To do this one should press the <<control>> button in the <<MD>> mode and holding the button start the count of pulse from the internal generator by pressing the button <<start/stop>>.  A working dosimeter must display the figure $1{,}024$ after the count period has elapsed.

Before working in the nuclear laboratory one must do the following.

\begin{Enumerate}{tab}

\Item. Check the dosimeter operation.

\Item. Measure the natural radiation background at several locations in the laboratory away from radiation sources.

\Item. Measure the level of radiation at the workplace.

\Item. A radioactive source is installed inside a lead container with a narrow channel (collimator) through which a $\gamma$-ray beam comes to an experimental installation. One should measure the radiation intensity near the container and right against the collimator.  

\Item. The measurement of radiation levels is done once before the experiment chosen by the laboratory instructor. One should record the results of the measurement, calculate the effective equivalent biological dose, compare the dose received during the experiment with the maximal allowed dose, and discuss the results with the instructor.  \end{Enumerate}%
