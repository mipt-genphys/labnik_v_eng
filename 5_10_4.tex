\textbf{Spin and magnetic moment of atomic nucleus.} A conventional symbol for the net angular momentum of a nucleus is {\textbf{I}} to distinguish it from the atomic symbol \textbf{J}. Often {\textbf{I}} is referred to as nuclear <<spin>>. Here a <<spin>> is understood as the proper (not orbital) part of the total angular momentum, while \textbf{L} stands for the orbital angular momentum of nucleons. Thus the net angular momentum of a nucleus is 
$$
\textbf{I}=\textbf{L}+\textbf{S}\,. \eqMark{10_4_1}
$$

According to quantum theory, the total angular momentum {\textbf{I}} of an isolated system (e.g. a nucleus) can be either an integer or a half-integer (in units of $\hbar$). For an even number $A$ of nucleons, there is always $I=0,\,1,\,2,...$, while for an odd one, $I={1\over2},\,{3\over2},....$ It is remarkable that this would not be true if a nucleus were composed of protons and electrons.

Usually, a nucleus has also a magnetic moment $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ proportional to {\textbf{I}}. Currently the angular momenta and magnetic moments of stable and radioactive isotopes are well known. However, understanding of magnetic properties of nuclei is a more challenging task than those of atoms.

Magnetic dipole moment is an axial vector, so it does not reverse its sign under the transformation 
\textbf{r} to $-\textbf{r}$. Therefore only the dipole and all odd nuclear magnetic moments can be nonzero. Even magnetic moments in stationary states vanish.

The ratio of dipole magnetic moment $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ to angular momentum {\textbf{I}} is called the \emph{gyromagnetic ratio}; in atomic physics it is written as
$$\gamma=g\gamma_0\,,\eqMark{10_4_2}
$$
where $g$~is the Lande $g$-factor and the unit of $\gamma_0$ is the gyromagnetic ratio for orbital motion of electron:
$$\gamma_0=-\frac{e}{2m_ec}.\eqMark{10_4_3}
$$
Similarly, the unit in nuclear physics is
$$\gamma\sub{n}=\frac{e}{2Mc},\eqMark{10_4_4}
$$
where $M$~is the proton mass.

Thus a nuclear magnetic moment can be written as
$$\mu=\gamma\sub{n}\hbar I .\eqMark{10_4_5}
$$
A nuclear magnetic moment is measured in units of nuclear magneton,
$$
\mu\sub{n}=\frac{e\fhbar}{2Mc},\eqMark{10_4_6}
$$
hence 
$$
\mu=g\sub{n}\mu\sub{n}I\,,\eqMark{10_4_7}
$$
where $g\sub{n}$ is called the nuclear $g$-factor.

Equation~(7) shows that in order to calculate the magnetic moment of a nucleus one must know its  angular momentum. Let us briefly discuss how it can be determined.

\smallskip 1. \emph{Hyperfine structure of optical spectra.}
A hyperfine structure of atomic spectra is due to the interaction of magnetic field of atomic electrons and the magnetic moment of nucleus. The energy of electrons acquires a dependence on the magnitude of nuclear magnetic  moment and its orientation. The numerical value of $I$ is determined by counting the number of hyperfine structure components in the spectrum of a particular isotope.

\smallskip 2. \emph{Intensity alteration in band spectra of diatomic molecules with identical nuclei.}
This method also allows one to determine $I$. The intensity alteration takes place since a wave function of molecule with identical nuclei $\psi(x_1,x_2)$ must be either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to interchange of $x_1$ и $x_2$; here $x$ stands for coordinates and spin. The determination of $I$ is based on the observation that the ratio of statistical weights of symmetric and antisymmetric spin states is $(I+1)/I$. 

\smallskip 3. \emph{Nuclear reactions, $\beta$- and $\gamma$-decays.}
Suppose the spin of parent nuclide undergoing $\beta$-or $\gamma$-decay is known. Then one can deduce something about the spin of daughter nuclide and vice versa. This is because the decay probability (i.e. the lifetime of parent nuclide) depends on the spin and parity of the parent and daughter nuclides. The difference of the spins and the parities can be determined by the angular distribution of outgoing $\gamma\text{-}$quanta.

\smallskip 4. \emph{NMR.}
I.~Rabi passed neutral atoms through a strong magnetic field; this breaks a coupling between {\textbf{I}} and \textbf{J} and both vectors precess independently around \textbf{H} at frequency $\omega=g(eH/Mc)$, where $g$ is a gyromagnetic ratio. By applying a weak magnetic field $\textbf{H}'$ perpendicular to the main field one can change orientation of nuclear spins. This effect is detectable since it affects the motion of atoms.

This method can be applied to immobile nuclei, in this case it is called the NMR. This is the resonance absorption of electromagnetic energy in a material caused by remagnetization of nuclei, the phenomenon was discovered by F.~Bloch and E.~Purcell in 1946. NMR is detected by the energy absorption by a sample placed in a constant magnetic field $\textbf{H}_0$ and a HF magnetic field perpendicular to $\textbf{H}_0$. The method of NMR is very precise. A relative value of $\mu$ of a nucleus can be determined with an accuracy of $1:10^6$.

NMR is a purely nuclear effect; for this reason it is widely used in organic chemistry for studying composition and structure of chemicals, the dynamics and mechanisms of chemical reactions, and the structure of hydrogen bonds. In solid state physics NMR is used to measure magnetic susceptibility and electron density at the nucleus location, to study a metal-semiconductor phase transition, and to study superconductive properties of $^3$He at low temperature.

In this experiment NMR is used to measure nuclear $g$-factors and to determine the magnetic moments of nuclei.

\medskip\textbf{\so{Experimental installation}}

\smallskip A nuclear level in magnetic field splits into the Zeeman levels and a HF field can induce electromagnetic transitions between them. This is a resonance phenomenon, that is why it is called nuclear magnetic resonance. The energy gap between two adjacent levels is 
$$\Delta E=\gyabor\mu\sub{n} B_0. \eqMark{10_4_8}
$$
The energy of quanta inducing the transitions is the same, the corresponding frequency is:
$$f_0=\frac{\Delta E}{h}=\frac{g{\mu}_\textrm{n}B_0}{h}. \eqMark{10_4_9}
$$

Notice that NMR transitions (just like EPR ones) occur between the adjacent Zeeman levels which all have the same orbital number $L$ and therefore the same parity. For this reason the electric dipole transitions are not allowed and only $M1$ transitions are induced. The probability of such transitions is much less than that of $E1$-transitions and in the optical range they cannot be seen (strongly suppressed). However a high intensity of electromagnetic wave (<<many photons>>) is easily achieved within a resonance circuit in the radio range, so here NMR can be obtained.

The experimental installation is similar to that one described in~10.3.

Unlike the installation in~10.3 the NMR signal here is detected by means of a commercial device. The modulating magnetic field is supplied by a small coil in which the sample and the detector are inserted, the modulation frequency is $\simeq 50\,$Hz. The NMR signal obtained at this modulation frequency looks rather unusual (see Fig.\,П$2$ in the Appendix).

The magnetic field in the electromagnet air gap is measured by means of a Hall sensor. The NMR is obtained on the samples made of rubber (NMR on protons), teflon (NMR on fluorine), and heavy water.

\Task

1. \emph{NMR on protons.} Insert a cylinder made of vacuum rubber into the coil of indicator installation. Place the coil into the electromagnet air gap so that its axis is perpendicular to the magnetic field lines. Set the frequency $f_0$ in the range $(1\div 20)$\,MHz and by slowly varying the magnetic field obtain the NMR signal on the rubber protons. Measure the resonance field with the aid of the Hall sensor.

If the signal is weak while the installation is properly operating the coil with the sample must be moved to a region where the magnetic field is more homogeneous. Use a steel ball in a glass tube to find such a region. In a homogeneous field the ball rests in neutral equilibrium. To verify that the width and therefore the amplitude of NMR signal depend on the field homogeneity bring a steel ball close to the sample. This makes the signal wider.

Calculate the proton $g$-factor using the frequency $f_0$ and the induction $B_0$. Since the angular momentum of proton is equal to its spin, the proton magnetic moment can be easily calculated by its $g$-factor:
$$
g_\textrm{p}=\frac{2\fpi}{\fmu_\textrm{n}} \frac{f_{0\textrm{p}}}{B_{0\textrm{p}}} \hbar .\eqMark{10_4_10}
$$

\smallskip 2. \emph{NMR on fluorine nuclei.} Obtain the NMR signal on protons and then slowly increase the magnetic field until the signal on fluorine nuclei is obtained. The fluorine is a chemical constituent of teflon which the coil frame is made of. The signal is lower and wider than that on protons. To increase the signal replace the rubber cylinder with a teflon one. Measure the resonance field and evaluate the $g$-factor of fluorine nucleus, then calculate the nucleus magnetic moment by assuming that the angular momentum of the external proton in fluorine nucleus is determined by the proton spin.

\smallskip 3. \emph{Measurement of deuteron $g$-factor.} Insert a glass capsule with heavy water (D$_2$O) in the coil. The generator frequency must be in the range of $(3\div 5)$\,MHz. When searching for the NMR signal keep in mind that the resonance magnetic induction at this frequency is around several kG.

\smallskip 4. Compare the $g$-factors and magnetic moments obtained with the tabulated values. Assuming that the main deuteron state is a mixture of two orbital states $^3$S$_1$ and $^3$D$_1$ evaluate the contribution of state $P_{D}$ using Eq.~(A19).

\textbf{Quarks and magnetic moments of nucleons}

\medskip

Magnetic moment of proton is 
$$\mu_p=2.792763\mu\sub{n} , \eqno(\textrm{A}1)
$$
and that of neutron is
$$\mu_n=-1.91315\mu\sub{n} . \eqno(\textrm{A}2)
$$
The corresponding $g$-factors are
$$g_p=5.58\,,\quad g_n=-3.82 . \eqno(\textrm{A}3)
$$

The magnetic moment of a free charged particle with the nucleon mass and which wave function is governed by the Dirac equation is equal to one nuclear magneton. The above data therefore suggest that free nucleons have an anomalous magnetic moment. Neutron is even more mysterious: it has no electric charge although it has a magnetic moment which sign is opposite to that of the proton. These facts indicate that nucleons are not <<elementary>> particles per se but must be composed of more <<elementary>> (fundamental) particles. Nowadays we know that these particles are quarks.
 
Quark hypothesis explained a lot of mysterious phenomena like magnetic moments of protons and neutrons and predicted others which were later confirmed by experiment. 

Let us calculate the magnetic moment of nucleon in the quark model. It is known from experiment that orbital angular momentum of quarks in a nucleon is equal to zero. Therefore nucleon is the lowest energy state of a three quark system which magnetic moment equals the sum of magnetic moments of the quarks. The latter are directed along the quark spins. Quark composition of proton and neutron is $(uud)$ and $(ddu)$, respectively. Therefore, since the spins of $u$- and $d$-quarks and a nucleon equal 1/2, spins of two quarks must be parallel while the third spin must be oppositely directed. 

Let us show that spins of two quarks of the same flavor must be parallel using proton as an example. Proton is a fermion, its wave function $\Psi_p$ is antisymmetric and can be written as a product of its spin $\psi_\textrm{s}(S_u,S_u,S_d)$, position $\psi_\textrm{p}(r_1,r_2,r_3)$, and color $\psi_\textrm{c}(u_\textrm{r},u_\textrm{g},d_\textrm{b})$ wave functions: 
$$\Psi_\textrm{as}=\psi_\textrm{s}(S_u,S_u,S_d)\psi_\textrm{p}(r_1,r_2,r_3) \psi_\textrm{c}(u_\textrm{r},u_\textrm{g},d_\textrm{b}) . \eqno(\textrm{A}4)
$$
Color wave function is always antisymmetric because it must enforce Pauli principle when other quantum numbers of the same flavor fermions are equal. Position wave function is symmetric since the orbital quantum number $L=0$. Therefore the spin wave function is symmetric with respect to permutation of $u$-quarks, i.e. $\psi_\textrm{s}(S_u,S_u,S_d)=\psi_\textrm{s}(\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow)$, as required.

Quarks are considered as elementary fermions which magnetic moments are proportional to their charges. Therefore magnetic moments of $u$- and $d$-quarks can be written as
$$
\mu_u=\frac{2}{3}\mu_a,\quad \mu_d=-\frac{1}{3}\mu_a , \eqno(\textrm{A}5)
$$
where $\mu_a$~is an elementary magnetic moment which will be calculated. A nucleon is a pair of two identical quarks with momentum $J=1$ to which a quark with momentum $J=1/2$ is added. The magnetic moment of a quark pair is ${4\over3}\,\mu_a$ and $-{2\over3}\,\mu_a$ for the pair $u\uparrow u\uparrow$ and $d\uparrow d\uparrow$, respectively.

The net magnetic moment of a nucleon is easily found by using the quantum rule of addition of  angular momenta. Suppose there is a system of two particles with spins and magnetic momenta $\textbf{s}_1$, $\boldsymbol{\mu}_1$ and $\textbf{s}_2$, $\boldsymbol{\mu}_2$, and their net spin and magnetic moment is $\textbf{I}$ and $\boldsymbol{\mu}$. In a central field the net angular momentum $\textbf{I}$ is conserved while $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ conserves only its component $\mu_I$ in the direction of $\textbf{I}$. It is this component which is called the magnetic moment of a system because it determines the system behavior in an external field. Thus
$$
{\mu}\equiv\boldsymbol{\mu}_I=\boldsymbol{\mu}_1\cos(\textbf{s}_1,\,\textbf{I})+\boldsymbol{\mu}_2\cos(\textbf{s}_2,\,\textbf{I}) . \eqno(\textrm{A}6)
$$

Since $\textbf{I}-\textbf{s}_1=\textbf{s}_2$, and $\textbf{I}-\textbf{s}_2=\textbf{s}_1$, then squaring these equations one obtains:
$$I^2-2|\textbf{I}||\textbf{s}_1|\cos(\textbf{s}_1\textbf{I})+s_1^2=s_2^2,\eqno(\textrm{A}7\textrm{a})
$$

$$I^2-2|\textbf{I}||\textbf{s}_2|\cos(\textbf{s}_2\textbf{I})+s_2^2=s_1^2,\eqno(\textrm{A}7\textrm{b})
$$
whence
$$\cos(\textbf{s}_1\textbf{I})=\frac{I^2+s_1^2-s_2^2}{ 2|\textbf{I}||\textbf{s}_1|},\eqno(\textrm{A}8\textrm{a})
$$

$$\cos(\textbf{s}_2\textbf{I})=\frac{I^2+s_2^2-s_1^2}{ 2|\textbf{I}||\textbf{s}_2|}.\eqno(\textrm{A}8\textrm{b})
$$
Thus,
$$
\mu=\mu_1 \frac{I^2+s_1^2-s_2^2}{ 2|\textbf{I}||\textbf{s}_1|}+ \mu_2\frac{I^2+s_2^2-s_1^2}{ 2|\textbf{I}||\textbf{s}_2|}.\eqno(\textrm{A}9)
$$
Now let us multiply both terms by $|\textbf{I}|$ from the right:
$$\mu=\mu_1 \frac{I^2+s_1^2-s_2^2}{ 2|\textbf{I}|^2}\frac{|\textbf{I}|}{ |\textbf{s}_1|}+ \mu_2\frac{I^2+s_2^2-s_1^2}{ 2|\textbf{I}|^2}\frac{|\textbf{I}|}{|\textbf{s}_2|}.\eqno(\textrm{A}9\textrm{a})
$$
In quantum mechanics the square of any vector $\textbf{F}$, which maximal projection on any axis is $F$, equals $F(F+1)$, while the ratios $|\textbf{I}|/|\textbf{s}_1|$ and $|\textbf{I}|/|\textbf{s}_2|$ are the ratios of their $z$-components equal to 1/2 and 1. Then
$$
\mu=\mu_1\frac{3/4+2-3/4}{2\cdot3/4}\,\frac{1}{2}+\mu_2\frac{3/4+3/4-2}{2\cdot3/4}\,1= \frac{2\mu_1-\mu_2}{3} .\eqno(\textrm{A}10)
$$

We use this equation to calculate magnetic moments of protons and neutrons, which gives
$$
\mu_\textrm{p}=\mu_a,\quad \mu_\textrm{n}=-\frac{2}{3}\,\mu_a .\eqno(\textrm{A}11)
$$
Therefore the ratio of magnetic moments of neutron and proton is $\mu_\textrm{n}/\mu_\textrm{p}=-2/3$, which is in a good agreement with experimental value $-0,685$.

Equations~(A5) suggest that proper magnetic moments $\mu_u$ and $\mu_d$ are $2/3\,\mu_\textrm{p}$ and $-1/3\,\mu_\textrm{p}$. Suppose the magnetic moment of a quark with a mass $m_q$ and a charge $Q_q$ can be derived from the Dirac equation. Then
$$
\mu_q=\frac{e\hbar}{2m_qc}\,Q_q=\frac{e\hbar}{2m_\textrm{p}c}\,\frac{m_\textrm{p}}{ m_q}\,Q_q={\muyabor}\,\frac{m_\textrm{p}}{ m_q}\,Q_q . \eqno(\textrm{A}12)
$$
Therefore the magnetic moment of $u$-quark is $2{\muyabor}$ and the proton magnetic moment is $3{\muyabor}$, which agrees well with the experimental value of $2.8{\muyabor}$.

Notice that quantum chromodynamics calculations of magnetic moments of nucleons agree with experimental values within several percent. 

\bigskip \textbf{Magnetic moments of compound nuclei}

\vspace{2pt}
Turning to nuclear magnetic moments notice that while nuclear spin is additive quantity, nuclear magnetic moment is not (assuming that magnetic moments of <<free>> nucleons (A11) and (A12) are chosen as the units).

\medskip \emph{Deuteron.} Deuteron is the simplest of compound nuclei, it consists of proton and neutron. The deuteron spin equals unity, so the spins of its nucleons are parallel. However, even in deuteron the net magnetic moment is not exactly the algebraic sum of magnetic moments of the proton and the neutron.

Indeed, the experimental values of the magnetic moment and $g$-factor of deuteron are 
$$
\mu_d=0.857348{\muyabor} ,\quad g_d=0.858 . \eqno(\textrm{A}13)
$$
Thus, the difference of the deuteron magnetic moment and that of its nucleons is
$$
\mu_d-(\mu_p+\mu_n)=-0{.}022265\,{\muyabor} , \eqno(\textrm{A}14)
$$
where the measurement accuracy is guaranteed up to the sixth digit. 

Assuming a central potential force acting between the deuteron nucleons one can infer that the system ground state must be an $S$-state, i.e. the deuteron orbital momentum is $L=0$. Experiment shows that the deuteron spin equals unity, so the ground state is a triplet $^3S_1$. At the same time the evident violation of additivity and the existence of a deuteron quadrupole electric moment indicate that the state $^3S_1$ cannot be the ground state. If it were so,    the additivity would not be violated and there were no quadrupole moment. Indeed, a wave function with $L=0$ is spherically symmetric, so the quadrupole moment vanishes. 

The contradiction between theory and experiment can be resolved by letting the ground deuteron state be a <<mixture>> of the states $^3S_1$ and $^3D_1$ (with $L=2$). A state with $L=1$,  i.e. $P$-state cannot be an admixture since odd and even $L$ cannot coexist in the same wave function due to parity conservation. In other words, the deuteron magnetic moment receives a contribution from the orbital motion of its nucleons.

Since the ground deuteron state is a mixture of two orbital states, the orbital quantum number $L$  is not conserved. Therefore the potential force between the nucleons cannot be central, it is rather a tensor force. 

Let us determine the contribution of the state $^3D_1$ to the magnetic moment of deuteron. A general expression for the operator of magnetic moment of the neutron$+$proton system is:
$$
\widehat\mu=\mu_n\widehat\sigma_n+\mu_p\widehat\sigma_p+\widehat{\textbf{L}}_p , \eqno(\textrm{A}15)
$$
where $\widehat\sigma_n$ and $\widehat\sigma_p$~are neutron and proton spins, $\mu_n$  and $\mu_p$~are neutron and proton magnetic moments in units of $\muyabor$, and $\widehat{\textbf{L}}_p$~-is the operator of orbital angular momentum of the proton which is equal to one-half of the net orbital momentum \textbf{L} of deuteron. The neutron does not contribute to the orbital magnetic moment since it does not have an electric charge. The coefficient at $\widehat{\textbf{L}}_p$ equals unity because the magnetic moment is measured in the units of $\muyabor$. Now, introducing the net spin of the system $\widehat{\textbf{S}}=\frac{1}{2}(\widehat\sigma_n+\widehat\sigma_p)$, one obtains 
$$
\widehat\mu=(\mu_n+\mu_p)\widehat{\textbf{S}}+\frac{1}{2}(\mu_n-\mu_p)(\widehat\sigma_n-\widehat\sigma_p)+\frac{1}{2}\widehat{\textbf{L}} . \eqno(\textrm{A}15a)
$$
instead of (A15).

The expectation value of operator $(\widehat\sigma_n-\widehat\sigma_p)$ in the triplet state vanishes since the spins of the nucleons are parallel. Introduction of the net angular momentum  {\textbf{I}} allows one to write:
$$
\widehat\mu=(\mu_n+\mu_p)\widehat{\textbf{I}}-(\mu_n+\mu_p-1/2)\widehat{\textbf{L}} . \eqno(\textrm{A}16)
$$
The measured magnetic moment is equal to the expectation value of operator (A$16$) in the state with $I_z=I$. Let us replace $\widehat{\textbf{L}}$ with $L_z$ in Eq.~(A$16$):
$$
\textbf{L}\rightarrow L_z=\frac{(\textbf{LI})I_z}{ I^2}= \frac{I(I+1)+L(L+1)-S(S+1)}{2I(I+1)}\,I_z . \eqno(\textrm{A}17)
$$
Using $I(I+1)=S(S+1)$ for the deuteron one can write for the mixture of $S$- and $D$-states:
$$
\langle L(L+1)\rangle_\textrm{av}=0\cdot P_S+6\cdot P_D , \eqno(\textrm{A}18)
$$
where $P_S$ and $P_D$~are statistical weights of the corresponding states. 

Finally, for $I=1$:
$$
\mu_{d}=\mu_n+\mu_p-\frac{3}{2} \left(\mu_n+\mu_p-\frac{1}{2}\right)P_D.\eqno(\textrm{A}19)
$$

Comparison of Eq.~(19) and the experimental value $\mu_{d\,\textrm{exp}}$ allows one to determine the contribution of $^3D_1$ state $P_D$.

\bigskip \emph{Nuclei with even $Z$ and even $N$ and with one extra nucleon.} Experiment shows that spin and magnetic moment of a nucleus with even $Z$ and even $N$ vanish. Moreover, such nuclei are very stable, i.e. they are similar to atoms with completely occupied electron shells. This fact shows that neutrons and protons in such nuclei are arranged so that their spins and magnetic moments cancel out. Indeed no nuclear spin exceeds several units, which is much less than $A/2$, the value that would be realized if the spins of all nucleons were parallel. The same applies to nuclear magnetic moment. 

What happens with an even-even nucleus with one extra nucleon added? It is natural to assume (Schmitt, 1937) that the angular momentum and the magnetic moment of an odd nucleus are determined by the net angular momentum and the magnetic moment of the unpaired nucleon:
$$
{\textbf{I}}=\textbf{l}+\textbf{s},\quad \boldsymbol{\mu}=g_l \mu_\textrm{я} \textbf{l}+g_s \mu_\textrm{я} \textbf{s} , \eqno(\textrm{A}20)
$$

The quantities {\textbf{I}} and $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ are calculated by using the quantum rules of vector addition, which gives:

for an extra proton
$$
\mu_\textrm{nuc}=(I+2.29)\muyabor \quad\quad\quad  \textrm{for} \quad I=l+1/2,\eqno(\textrm{A}21\textrm{a})
$$

\vspace{-12pt}
$$
\mu_\textrm{nuc}=\left(1-\frac{2.29}{ I+1}\right)I\muyabor \quad  \textrm{for} \quad I=l-1/2,\eqno(\textrm{A}21\textrm{b})
$$

for an extra neutron
$$\mu_\textrm{nuc}=-1{.}91\muyabor \quad~  \textrm{for} \quad I=l+1/2,    \quad\quad\quad~\eqno(\textrm{A}22\textrm{a})
$$

\vspace{-12pt}
$$\mu_\textrm{nuc}=\frac{1{.}91}{ I+1}I\muyabor \quad  \textrm{for} \quad I=l-1/2.     \quad\quad\quad~\eqno(\textrm{A}22\textrm{b}).
$$

Equations (A21) and (A22) show that the sign of the nucleon magnetic moment is determined by the mutual orientation of vectors $\textbf{s}$ and $\textbf{l}$ and by the magnitude of \emph{I}. For instance, a proton in the state $p_{1/2}$ ($l=1$, $I=1/2$) has $\mu={-0.26}{\muyabor}$ (instead of ${+2{.}79}{\muyabor}$ in $s$-state), while neutron in the same state has the moment ${+0{.}64}{\muyabor}$ (instead of ${-1{.}91}{\muyabor}$). This values are in a good agreement with the actual magnetic moments of $^{13}_{\:\:6}$C  ($0{.}7\muyabor$) and $^{15}_{\:\:7}$N ($0{.}28\muyabor$). The agreement can be attributed to the fact that the spin and magnetic moment of $^{15}_{\:\:7}$N, which has the odd number of protons ($7$) and the even number of neutrons ($8$), are determined by an unpaired proton in the state $p_{1/2}$ ($p$-proton). A nucleus $^{13}_{\:\:6}$C has the even number of protons ($6$) and the odd number of neutrons ($7$), so its spin and magnetic moment are determined by an unpaired neutron in the state $p_{1/2}$ ($p$-neutron).

As an example consider fluorine nucleus $^{19}_{\:\:9}$F. It has 9 protons and 10 neutrons, i.e. the magnetic moment is determined by an unpaired proton. Eight protons fill the first (state $1s_{1/2}$, 2 protons) and the second (states $2p_{1/2}$ and $2p_{3/2}$, 6 protons) shells, so the ninth proton resides on the third shell in the state $3d_{5/2}$. For this reason one should expect the spin of $^{19}_{\:\:9}$F to be 5/2. Actually, the spin equals 1/2. This could be explained by assuming that the state $2s_{1/2}$ is filled first. If so, the orbital motion of the proton does not contribute to the nuclear magnetic moment which is due to the magnetic moment of the proton only. Therefore, the magnetic moment of $^{19}_{\:\:9}$F should be equal to $+2.792763{\muyabor}$. The experimental value is $+2.6285{\muyabor}$, i.e. it is not very different from that of proton.

Nevertheless, the cases considered above are rare exceptions. As a rule, the experimental values of magnetic moments of odd nuclei strongly deviate from predictions~(A21) and (A22), the so-called Schmitt curves.

{The diagram in Fig.~\:П1 shows the experimental values of the magnetic moments (in units of nuclear magneton) versus Schmitt curves for even-odd ($Z$ is even) and odd-even ($N$ is even) nuclei. If the magnetic momenta were exactly due to a single nucleon, all experimental points would reside on one of the curves. The diagram in Fig.~\:П1, \parfillskip=0pt shows

\textbf{NMR line for scanning magnetic field}

\vspace{2pt}
The typical feature of an NMR absorption experiment is the detection of resonance by its effect on the oscillator circuit generating a HF field. 

For example, consider the simplest design of NMR detection, namely, a radio frequency generator with an electronic oscillator which inductor coil contains the studied sample in its core (let the sample be water in a sealed glass ampule). The coil is placed in a constant magnetic field $H_0$. The absorption of the energy of HF wave by protons at the resonance reduces the quality factor $Q$ and the oscillation voltage across the circuit decreases.

Another feature of NMR should be mentioned as well. In thermodynamic equilibrium atoms are distributed over all possible energy states according to the Boltzmann distribution; an occupation number is proportional to $\exp(-h\nu/\kb T)$. For radio frequency and at room temperature the exponent is $h\nu/k_{_\textrm{B}}T\ll 1$. For instance, at $\nu=30$\,MHz and at room temperature the exponent is $5\cdot10^{-6}$. Therefore the difference between the occupation numbers of adjacent states, which determines the amplitude of resonance absorption, is very small. So, detection of NMR signal is not an easy task. Besides, only $M1$-quanta can be absorbed, which also decreases the resonance absorption.

To detect the resonance absorption, the measurement is usually done at a constant frequency, and the constant magnetic field is being modulated by small additional coils by a field with a small amplitude of several oersted. If the average value of magnetic induction coincides with the resonance value, the field passes through the resonance twice a period and modulates the amplitude of the carrier wave. The detected signal is amplified and displayed on the oscilloscope screen, which swipes are controlled by the modulating coils. In so doing we can visually observe the absorption curve shown in~Fig.~\:6 in~10.2. This is a so-called <<slow passage through the resonance>>.

Two conditions must be met in order to display correctly the absorption line on the oscilloscope screen. Firstly, the constant magnetic field must be homogeneous because the natural width of NMR line can be very small (for liquids it is several millioersted). Because of the inhomogeneity the resonance occurs at different values of magnetic induction, which broadens the line. Secondly, the induction must be varied so slowly that the circuit oscillations remain stationary (along with variation of the quality factor). Mathematically,
$$
\frac{dH_0}{ dt}\ll |\gamma|(\delta H_0)^2 , \eqno(\textrm{П}23)
$$
where $\delta H_0$~is the line width measured in units of induction.

If the above condition is not met non-stationary processes (oscillations) set in, as it is the case for the factory made NMR detector used in this experiment (see Fig.\:A2\emph{a}). The absorption line observed corresponds to the resonance on protons of $\vphantom{5^5}$ water in the field with a degree of inhomogeneity along the sample of $0{.}02$\% per $1$\,cm.

The diagram in Fig.\:A2\emph{b} illustrates how a NMR line is affected by a relatively large inhomogeneity of $0{.}05$\% per 1 cm.

Consider in some detail the origin of the absorption line <<wiggles>> first described by N.\:Bloembergen, E.\:Purcell, and R.\:Pound. A nucleus in magnetic field precesses at the angular frequency $\gamma H_0$, where $\gamma$~is the gyromagnetic ratio. When $H_0$ reaches the resonance value the nuclear magnetic moment is precessing in phase with the HF field (at the generator frequency $\nu_0\vphantom{x^5}$). When $H_0$ deviates from the resonance value the nuclei continue precession at the frequency $\gamma H_0$ and, if the field changes rapidly enough, the frequency induced by the nuclei in the measuring circuit differs from $\nu_0$. This gives rise to observable beats between the NMR signal and the HF field. The beats last until the precession phases of all nuclear moments coincide and the net magnetic moment is large enough. The coherence of the nuclear spin motion is due to the dipole-dipole interaction of nuclear magnetic moments and persists approximately during the spin relaxation time $T_2$.

The origin of spin-spin relaxation is due to the fact that a nuclear magnetic moment is subjected not only to the external magnetic field but also to a local magnetic field $H_\textrm{loc}$ of neighboring nuclei. The local field changes chaotically depending on the relative location of nuclei and their magnetic quantum number $m$. Obviously, if two spins initially in phase precess at different frequencies, they become decoherent in $T_2$; in other words, it is the time of <<phase memory>> which specifies the lifetime of a coherent state. The time $T_2$ is known as the transverse relaxation time. Notice, however, that the dipole-dipole interaction of magnetic moments determines $T_2$ in solids only, while in fluids one nearly always observes the natural NMR frequency.
