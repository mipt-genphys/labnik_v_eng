{Measurement of cross-section of ($\boldsymbol{e}^+\,\boldsymbol{e}^-$)-pair production in scattering of $\boldsymbol\gamma$-quanta on lead nuclei}
{Using two scintillation counters and a full energy Cherenkov detector one measures the cross-section of electron-positron pair production on lead nuclei as a function of $\gamma\text{-}$-quanta energy.}

Cosmic radiation is a regular flux of high-energy particles, mostly protons and $\alpha$-particles coming to the upper Earth atmosphere from all directions (primary cosmic rays), and the flux of secondary particles created in interactions of the primary rays with atomic nuclei: mostly, they are electrons ($e^{-}$), positrons ($e^+$), $\gamma\text{-}$quanta, pions ($\pi$) and muons ($\mu$), protons ($p$), neutrons ($n$), and neutrinos ($\nu$).

Nowadays the energy spectrum of primary cosmic rays is studied in the range from $\Simeq 10^9\;\eV$ to $(3\div5)\cdot 10^{19}\;\eV$. The number of particles versus energy $N(E)$ decreases as $E^{\xi}$, where $\xi =1{.}7\div 2.2$ for different $E$. High-energy particles colliding with atmospheric nuclei partially split them and produce a multitude of unstable elementary particles, mostly, pions $\pi^{\pm}$ and $\pi^{0}$ with the mean lifetime $\tau \Simeq 2{.}5 \cdot 10^{-8}\;\s$ and $\tau \Simeq 0{.}8 \cdot 10^{-16}\;\s$, respectively. The amount of kaons produced is $5\text{--}10$ times less, there are even less hyperons and antiprotons, and electrons and muons are produced at a negligible rate.

The decay channels of charged pions and kaons are 
$$ 
\begin{array}{c}   \pi^{+} \rightarrow \mu^+ +\nu_{\mu},\\   \pi^- \rightarrow  \mu^- + \widetilde{\nu}_{\mu},\\   K^{+} \rightarrow \mu ^+ + \nu_{\mu},\\    K^- \rightarrow \mu^{-} + \widetilde{\nu}_{\mu}. \end{array} \eqMark{7_3_1} 
$$
The corresponding muons ($\mu^{\pm}$) and neutrinos form the penetrating (or hard) component of secondary cosmic rays. Muons do not participate in the strong interactions, so high-energy muons (up to $\Simeq10^{12}\;\eV$) lose their energy mostly on ionization (at the rate $\Simeq 2\;\MeV\cdot\cm^2/\g$) and are capable of deep penetration into matter. The cross-section of neutrino interaction with matter is so small ($\Simeq10^{-39}\;\cm^2$) that neutrinos pass through the globe almost freely.

A small fraction of charged pions of a very high energy ($\Simeq 10^{12}\;\eV$) do not decay into muons in the atmosphere because of time dilation. The pions interact with atmospheric nuclei as
$$
\pi +A \rightarrow\pi + \pi + \pi + \ldots +A',
$$
$$
\pi +A \rightarrow p+p+ \ldots +n+n+ \ldots +A'',
\eqMark{7_3_2}
$$
$$
\pi +A \rightarrow \pi + \ldots +p+ \ldots +n+ \ldots +A''',
$$
thereby contributing to the nuclear-active component of cosmic rays. The nuclear-active component consists of pions ($\pi$), nucleons (neutrons and protons), and nuclear fragments. It derives its name from its ability to initiate reactions like those in Eq.~(\refEquation{7_3_2}). The nuclear-active component stops developing when the average energy per particle decreases to $\Simeq 10^8\div 10^9\;\eV$, i.e. when a multiple production of new particles ceases.

A neutral pion with energy less than $10^{18}\;\eV$ decays into two \mbox{$\gamma$-quanta} giving rise to an electromagnetic avalanche (electron-photon shower); the latter occurs due to $\gamma\text{-}$quantum conversion into an $(e^+\,e^-)$-pair and the bremsstrahlung radiation of electrons and positrons in the Coulomb field of nuclei (see~\refFigure {7_2_1} of~5.7.2)

Obviously the mean energy per particle rapidly decreases with each successive generation of the avalanche ($\langle E\rangle  \Simeq E_{\pi^0}/N$, where $N$~is the number of particles in a given generation). Electron-photon component of cosmic rays is also considered soft because it is easily absorbed, especially by a substance with large $Z$.

The ability of a substance to produce electron-photon showers initiated by $\gamma$-quanta of high energy is characterized by a radiation length $L_r$ (for electrons and positrons) and an absorption length $\lambda$ (for $\gamma\text{-}$quanta). Radiation length is a distance over which a high-energy electron ($E>1\;\GeV$) loses all but $1/e$ of its energy by bremsstrahlung ($\overline{e}$~is the base of natural logarithm). 

The bremsstrahlung is produced by a charged particle passing through the Coulomb field of a nucleus. The field accelerates the particle, so the latter radiates. Let the nucleus charge be $Ze$, and the particle charge, mass, and acceleration be $e$, $m$, and $w$, respectively. Then
 $$   
 w=-\frac{F}{m}=-\frac{e \EDS}{m}=-\frac{Ze^2}{mr^2},   \eqMark{7_3_3} 
 $$ 
 where $\EDS$ is the electric field intensity and $r$~is a distance to the nucleus (an impact parameter). The bremsstrahlung intensity $W$ (i.e. the energy radiated per second) in the non-relativistic classical limit is related to the acceleration~$w$ as
$$   
W=\frac{2}{3}\frac{e^2}{c^3}|w|^2=\frac{2}{3}\frac{Z^2e^6}{m^2c^3r^4}.   \eqMark{7_3_4} 
$$

Thus the radiation losses are inversely proportional to the square of particle mass and directly proportional to the square of the scattering center electric charge. One can see that the radiation losses can be significant only for electrons rather than for heavy particles. For instance, the radiation losses of proton are less by the factor of $(m_{p}/m_e)^2\Simeq 3\cdot 10^6$ compared to that of electron. A bremsstrahlung due to atomic electrons is insignificant since the radiation due to a nucleus is $Z^2$ times greater than due to electron while the number of electrons is only $Z$ times greater than the number of nuclei.

The photon absorption length $\lambda$ specifies attenuation of a flux of $\gamma\text{-}$quanta in a substance over distance:
$$   
I=I_0\exp(-t \rho/\lambda),   \eqMark{7_3_5} 
$$ 
where $t$~is a distance in $\cm$, $\rho$~is the substance density in $\g/\cm^3$, and $\lambda$~is the absorption length in~$\g/\cm^2$.

The absorption of high-energy electrons and $\gamma\text{-}$quanta is mostly due to $(e^{+}\,e^-)$-pair production,\Footnotemark \Footnotetext{Interaction processes of $\gamma\text{-}$quanta 
and the dependence of their cross-sections on energy are discussed in the introduction to chapter~V.}
$$
\gamma +A \rightarrow e^{+} e ^- +A,
\eqMark{7_3_6}
$$
which cross-section is almost constant for $E>1\;\GeV$, and the braking radiation of electrons and positrons in the Coulomb field of nuclei:
$$
e^{\pm} +A \rightarrow (e^{\pm})'+ \gamma\sub{br}+A.
\eqMark{7_3_7}
$$

The mean energy of electrons (positrons) in a shower rapidly decreases; soft electrons and positrons lose their energy by ionization and stop.

The radiation length $L_r$ and the absorption length $\lambda$ are related to pair production cross-section as:
$$
\begin{array}{c}
\sigma = \displaystyle\frac{7}{9} \left(\frac{A}{L_rN_{\mathrm A}}\right),\vspace{6pt}\\
\sigma = \displaystyle\frac{A}{\lambda N_{\mathrm A}},
\end{array}
\eqMark{7_3_8}
$$
where $\sigma$ is in $\cm^2$, and $L_r$ and $\lambda$~in $\g/\cm^2$.

Thus the cosmic rays at the sea level contain $\gamma\text{-}$quanta of different energies, which allows one to use them for measuring the energy dependence of $(e^+\,e^-)$-pair production. It  is not difficult to separate the events initiated by $\gamma\text{-}$quanta with the aid of an ordinary particle counter detecting only charged particles. The goal of this experiment is the measurement of cross-section of electron-positron pair production by high-energy $\gamma\text{-}$quanta on lead nuclei.\vspace{1ex}

\textbf{\so{Experimental setup}}\vspace{5pt}

Consider the operation principle of a Cherenkov detector used to detect electron-positron pairs in this experiment.
 
The speed of light in a substance is given by the equation
$$
c'=\frac{c}{n},
\eqMark{7_3_9}
$$
where $n$~is the refraction index. Since $n>1$ a high energy particle can travel faster than light in this substance. If such a superluminal particle carries an electric charge, it will radiate. The radiation was discovered by P.~A.~Cherenkov and named after him. The Cherenkov radiation is similar to the shock wave emitted by a bullet in the air or a bow shock wave produced by a ship.

The Cherenkov radiation is produced by coherent atomic dipoles induced in a medium by a charged particle traveling faster than the speed of light in the medium. The electric field of the particle displaces atomic electrons from their equilibrium positions thereby inducing the dipole momenta of atoms. When the particle leaves the region of excited dipoles, they return to equilibrium and radiate an electromagnetic pulse. 

If the particle speed is relatively low, the polarization is induced symmetrically around the particle because the electric field has <<enough time>> to polarize all atoms in the particle neighborhood including those ahead. In this case the radiation field of different dipoles cancels out, and the net radiation far away from the particle vanishes.

If the particle speed exceeds the speed of light in the medium ($v>c'=c/n$), a peculiar retardation effect occurs: the induced dipoles are primarily directed along the particle velocity.

The angle $\theta$ of Cherenkov light (the angle between the particle velocity $\textbf{v}$ and a wavevector $\textbf{k}$) is specified by the condition
$$
\cos\theta =\frac{c}{nv}.
\eqMark{7_3_10}
$$

This condition is purely kinematic, it means that waves of any origin radiated along the source path are in phase on the corresponding conical surface (see~\refFigure{7_3_1}).

The energy of Cherenkov radiation is converted from the kinetic energy of the particle, so the latter decelerates. However the deceleration does not affect the radiation mechanism. The radiation is possible even if the particle motion is uniform provided the particle speed exceeds the phase speed of light in the medium.

The Cherenkov radiation is widely used for particle detection. The corresponding particle counter is called a Cherenkov detector and the medium in which the radiation is observed is called a radiator. The radiator must be transparent for the Cherenkov radiation

and must have a low scintillation background. The counter optical system focuses the light coming from a particle on the PMT cathode which transforms the scintillation into an electric pulse.\looseness=-1

In the experiment one employs a full energy Cherenkov detector designed for detection and spectrometry of electrons and $\gamma\text{-}$quanta. A thick lead glass is used as the radiator in which an energetic electron or a photon generates an electron-photon shower and completely loses its energy. The intensity of light emitted in the detector is proportional to the energy of the primary electron or $\gamma\text{-}$quantum.

The installation consists of two detectors of charged particles: plastic scintillation counters, a lead radiator, a Cherenkov detector and electronic circuits which register pulses coming from the detectors.\Footnotemark\Footnotetext{Operation principles of scintillation counters, PMT, and nuclear electronic circuitry are discussed in Appendices~ II--IV.}. The detector dimensions are $30\times 10\times 2\;\cm$, they are connected to a double anticoincidence circuit. Such a system is called telescope. It allows one to separate the events caused by passage of particles of cosmic radiation coming in a certain direction and the background noise of PMT and charged particles. The installation scheme is shown in~\refFigure{7_3_3}.

Gamma-quanta of cosmic radiation produce $(e^+\, e^- )$-pairs in the lead glass (the radiator), the pairs go through the lower scintillation counter~\textit{SC2} and come to the full energy Cherenkov detector~\textit{CD}. The detector is a parallelepiped $20\;\cm$ in height and a cross-section of $10\times 10\;\cm$ made of lead glass. A detector of this size completely absorbs electrons with energy less than $150\;\MeV$.

The Cherenkov radiation caused by electrons (positrons) is registered by a PMT at the cylinder bottom. The detector surface is covered with a reflective coating, i.e. the PMT detects all light emitted by a particle. Hence the light intensity is a function of the particle energy. The dependence of the magnitude of light pulse on particle energy is calibrated by cosmic muons; for each detector the dependence is shown on the installation.

In the experiment one must register only the pairs produced by $\gamma\text{-}$quanta. The corresponding electrons and positrons passed through the scintillation counter \textit{SC2} are detected by the Cherenkov counter. The counters~\textit{SC1} and~\textit{SC2} are connected in the anticoincidence circuit in order to separate the events caused by the pair production in the radiator. The electric pulse at the circuit output is generated if and only if a charged particle passes through a single counter. Therefore the events in which electrons, positrons, and muons of cosmic rays pass through the telescope are not detected.

A single-channel pulse analyzer~\textit{SA} at the output of the Cherenkov detector selects a signal corresponding to electron or positron in a certain energy range. The signal is then applied to the coincidence circuit together with a pulse from the anticoincidence circuit~\textit{AC} and to the pulse counter. In so doing the setup separates the events corresponding to pair creation in the lead radiator by $\gamma\text{-}$quanta of a certain energy. Of course, the Cherenkov detector also detects the pairs created by $\gamma\text{-}$quanta which did not interact with lead nuclei. These events are excluded by the coincidence circuit~\textit{CC}. Notice that the count rate of these events allows one to determine the flux of cosmic $\gamma\text{-}$quanta and therefore to evaluate the cross-section of the process $\gamma +\mathrm{Pb} \rightarrow e^{+} +e^{-}$.

Thus the installation operates as follows. A charged particle passing through the scintillators~\textit{SC1} and~\textit{SC2} produces scintillations detected by PMTs. The PMT signals are then applied to the anticoincidence circuit consisting of the time-to-digital converters~\textit{TDC1} and \textit{TDC2}, which produce signals of standard amplitude and duration, and the <<OR>> gate~\textit{AC}. The TDCs are included in the coincidence circuit in order to amplify the selection coefficient because the PMT output always produces a noise imitating the signal of a charged particle. The signal from the output of~\textit{AC} is then applied to an input of~\textit{CC} and registered by a digital counter~\textit{DC}. A signal from the Cherenkov counter caused by a charged particle of high energy is applied to the other~\textit{CC} input. The single-channel analyzer~\textit{SA} between~\textit{CD} and \textit{CC} separates signals of a given amplitude which corresponds to a certain particle energy. \vspace{1ex}

\textbf{\so{Directions}}\vspace{5pt}

\begin{Enumerate}{tab}

\Item. Turn the installation on and let it warm up for $10$--$15\;\mi$.

\Item. Measure the count rate of cosmic $\gamma$-quanta without the lead radiator at five different energies (the amplitudes of the corresponding pulses of the Cherenkov detector are shown on the installation). To do this switch the anticoincidence circuit of scintillation counters to the coincidence mode and switch the coincidence circuit to the anticoincidence mode. In this case the Cherenkov detector registers only the cosmic $\gamma\text{-}$quanta of high energy. Record the number of events detected per a given time interval by adjusting the level of the single-channel analyzer.

\Item. Insert the lead radiator between the scintillation counters, switch the coincidence and anticoincidence circuits to the mode of detection of electron-positron pairs and measure the number of events at the same energy of $\gamma\text{-}$quanta.

\Item. Double the lead radiator thickness and verify that the rate of pair production also doubles.

\Item. Replace the lead radiator by an aluminum one and do the measurement for a single energy of $\gamma\text{-}$quanta.

\Item. Using the data obtained calculate the cross-section of pair production in lead.

\Item. Calculate the number of nuclei in the radiators for a given thickness of aluminum and lead plates. Using the ratio of the count rates in lead and aluminum evaluate the cross-section dependence on the charge of nucleus $Z$.

\Item. Using Eqs.~(\refEquation{7_3_8}) calculate the radiation length $L_r$ and the absorption length of $\gamma\text{-}$quantum in lead averaged over energy. \end{Enumerate}%
