{Measurement of angular distribution of hard component of cosmic rays}
{Measurement of angular distribution of hard component of cosmic rays}
{Angular distribution of hard component of cosmic radiation is measured, and the muon lifetime is determined from the results obtained.}

Cosmic rays are the stable particles and atomic nuclei originated and accelerated to high energy in outer space come to the upper layers of Earth atmosphere from all directions (primary cosmic rays). The particles produced in collisions of the primary cosmic rays with atmospheric nuclei are usually referred to as secondary cosmic rays.

The primary cosmic rays consist mostly of protons ($\Simeq90\%$), $\alpha$-particles ($\Simeq10\%$), and a small amount of heavier nuclei up to uranium. The energy of some particles reaches macroscopic values, up to $10^{20}\;\eV\Simeq20\;\Dj$. Because of that the cosmic rays are the natural source of particles with the energies not yet available in modern particle accelerators.

Passage of cosmic rays through the atmosphere is a complicated process of gradual absorption of the primary component and generation of the secondary component. The secondary component is produced in interactions of fast particles (both primary and secondary) with air nuclei. As a result the number of secondary particles grows in the upper atmospheric layers while close to the sea level the intensity of cosmic radiation decreases because the particles are getting absorbed by air. 

The generation of various secondary particles begins with the first interaction of a primary proton with an atmospheric nucleus, i.e. either with nitrogen or oxygen. The interaction cross-section is close to the geometric one, i.e. 
\begin{Multline}
\sigma\sub{\textit{p}\,air}\Simeq \pi R^2=\pi (R_0A^{1/3})^2=\\   =3{.}14\cdot (1{.}3 \cdot 10^{-13}\cdot 14^{1/3})^2=300\cdot10^{-27}\;\cm^2=300\;\text{mb},   \eqMark{7_1_1}
\end{Multline}%
and slowly increases with energy. Given this cross-section the atmospheric layer of $1000\;\g/\cm^2$ thick becomes an effective shield of the thickness of $8\div12$ free proton paths, so only a minute fraction of the protons (and even a lesser part of a heavier cosmic nuclei) which did not participate in an interaction reaches the sea level. 

A primary proton colliding with an air nucleus retains approximately one half of its initial energy, the other half is the energy required to split the nucleus and to produce secondary particles, mostly, pions ($70\div80\%$), kaons ($10\div20\%$), and hyperons ($\Simeq 1\%$). The charged positive and negative pions either decay with a lifetime $\tau_0=2{.}5\cdot10^{-8}\;\s$) as
$$
\pi^{\pm}\rightarrow \mu^{\pm}+\nu,   \eqMark{7_1_2}
$$
or strongly interact with air nuclei. According to the quark model the pion interaction cross-section equals approximately two thirds of the proton cross-section. The pattern of interaction between a pion and an air nucleus is similar to the corresponding interaction pattern of proton.

Whether a pion decays or participates in interaction with a nucleus depends on its energy and the elevation, to be specific, on the atmospheric density at the pion location. Indeed, the decay path of an ultrarelativistic pion equals 
$$
L\sub{dec}=\beta c\tau_0\gamma=\frac{c\ftau_0E_{\pi}}{m_{\pi}c^2},   \eqMark{7_1_3}
$$
where $E_{\pi}$~is the total energy of pion of mass $m_{\pi}$ and $\tau_0$~is the pion lifetime in its restframe.

The free pion path between interaction events is
$$
L\sub{int}=\frac{1}{\fsigma_{\pi\,\text{air}}n}=\frac{A}{\fsigma_{\pi\,\text{air}}\frho N},   \eqMark{7_1_4}
$$
where
$$
\sigma_{\pi\,\text{air}}\Simeq \frac{2}{3} \sigma_{p\,\text{air}}\Simeq200\;\text{mb}.   \eqMark{7_1_5}
$$

The coefficient $2/3$ in Eq.~(\refEquation{7_1_5}) is due to the fact that proton consists of three quarks and a pion consists of two. The probability of decay equals the probability of interaction providing the decay path equals the mean free path. This happens at the energy
$$
E_{\pi}=\frac{Am_{\pi} c^2}{\sigma_{\pi\,\text{air}}\frho Nc\ftau_0}.   \eqMark{7_1_6}
$$

One can see that as the air density $\rho$ decreases, i.e. the higher the initial altitude, where a pion is created, the higher is the energy at which the mean free path becomes equal to the decay path. In other words, the higher the altitude of a pion generation, the larger is the probability of its decay.

Muons, the decay products of pions, do not strongly interact with atmospheric nuclei unlike pions and protons. They mostly interact with atomic electrons thereby ionizing atoms. Relativistic muons lose about $2\;\MeV$ per a path of $1\;\g/\cm^2$ for the ionization losses. A muon must have an energy not less than $2\;\GeV$ to traverse the whole atmosphere.

The muon mean lifetime $\tau_0=2\cdot 10^{-6}\;\s$, muons decay according to 
$$   
\mu^{+} \rightarrow e^{+} + \widetilde{\nu}_e+\nu_{\mu}~~\text{and}~~\mu^{-} \rightarrow e^- + \nu_e+\widetilde{\nu}_{\mu}.   \eqMark{7_1_7} 
$$ 
The lifetime of a particle moving with a speed $v=\beta c$ is dilated compared to the proper lifetime $\tau_0$:
$$
\tau = \frac{\ftau_0}{\sqrt{1-\fbeta^2}}=\frac{\ftau_0E}{m_{\mu} c^2}=\ftau_0\gamma\qquad\left({\vphantom{\frac{1}{2}}}\right.\gamma=\frac{E}{m_{\mu} c^2}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\fbeta^2}}\left){\vphantom{\frac{1}{2}}}\right..   \eqMark{7_1_8}
$$

Equation (\refEquation{7_1_3}) shows that the muon decay path with energy $2\;\GeV$ is
$$   
L\sub{dec}=\beta c\tau_0\gamma\Simeq12\;\km,   \eqMark{7_1_9} 
$$
i.e. a muon with an energy less than $1\div2\;\GeV$ decays before losing its energy for ionization of atmospheric atoms. An electron generated as the product of muon decay contributes mostly to the electronic component of the secondary cosmic rays and goes practically in the same direction as its parent muon.

Neutral pions are also produced in the strong interactions in addition to charged pions. The neutral pion mean lifetime $\tau_0=2\cdot 10^{-16}\;\s$ and the decay mode is
$$  
 \pi^0\rightarrow \gamma + \gamma.   \eqMark{7_1_10} 
$$

Neutral pions do not have time to interact with air nuclei since their lifetime is so small. The ensuing $\gamma$-quanta create electron-positron pairs in the Coulomb field of atomic nuclei:
$$   
\gamma +A \rightarrow e^{-} +e^{+} +A.   \eqMark{7_1_11} 
$$
Recall that a $\gamma$-quantum cannot decay into the pair in a free space since the laws of energy and momentum conservation are not satisfied in this process.  
 
The electrons and positrons emit bremsstrahlung $\gamma\text{-}$quanta in the field of atomic nuclei:
$$   
e^{\pm} +A\rightarrow (e^{\pm})' + \gamma +A.   \eqMark{7_1_12} 
$$

The bremsstrahlung quanta create electron-positron pairs which, in turn, emit bremsstrahlung $\gamma\text{-}$quanta during their interaction with nuclei and so on. As a result a single neutral pion can initiate the electron-positron avalanche in which the number of particles reaches $10^4\div10^6$ at the sea level. An interaction of a primary proton or a nucleus results in generation of numerous charged and neutral pions, so a single primary particle with an energy about $10^{20}\;\eV$  creates an avalanche of $10^{10}$ particles at the sea level. Mostly the avalanche particles are electrons and $\gamma\text{-}$quanta spread over an area of several square kilometers. 

Angular distribution of cosmic rays at the sea level shows that their intensity strongly depends on direction and rapidly increases when going from the horizon direction to zenith. Such a dependence seems natural because the particles coming from above pass a smaller atmospheric layer. However, as we have already discussed, the intensity of muons, the main fraction of hard component of cosmic radiation at the sea level, is determined mostly by their spontaneous decay. 

The main fraction of the muons is generated in the upper atmosphere, so one can say that muons pass the layer $\Simeq1000\;\g/\cm^2$ thick when going to the Earth surface. On the way the muons are partially get absorbed and partially decay. The muons coming at an angle $\theta$ to the vertical cover the path $1/\cos\theta$ times greater than the ones coming from above.

Increasing the air layer traversed by muons increases the probability of their decay on the way and  the probability of absorption because of ionization losses. Therefore the muon intensity decreases with $\theta$. These arguments show that the angular dependence of the intensity of cosmic rays must be approximately proportional to the cosine of zenith angle. The actual dependence is similar although it is more like $\cos^n\theta$, where $n$ is approximately $2$.

One can determine the fraction of the muons <<absorbed>> due to the increase of decay probability on a greater distance as follows. The vertical path of muons to the Earth surface is $L_0\Simeq15\;\km$ which can be obtained from a simple estimate. The mass of air column of the area of $1\;\cm^2$ in the model of isothermal atmosphere is 
\vspace{-6pt}
$$
M=\rho_0\int\limits_0^{\infty}\exp(-\mu gz/RT)\,dz={\rho_0} \frac{RT}{\fmu g}=\frac{P_0}{g}\Simeq1030\;\g,   \eqMark{7_1_13}
$$
where $\rho_0$~is the atmospheric density at the sea level, $P_0$~is the atmospheric pressure, $R$~is the universal gas constant, and $g$~is the free fall acceleration.

Assume that muons are generated in the upper atmospheric layer of thickness ${x_{\mu}\Simeq 150}\;\g/\cm^2$ (this value corresponds to the mean free path of a pion before it interacts with a nucleus). Then the height $a$ of the atmospheric layer with a mass of $\Simeq0{.}85$ of the total mass can be found from the equation:
\vspace{-6pt}
$$
\int\limits_0^ae^{-z}\,dz=0{.}85=1-e^{-a},
\eqMark{7_1_14}
$$
whence $e^{-a} =0{.}15$ and $a=-\ln0{.}15=1{.}9$. Thus the altitude of the atmospheric layer where the muons are generated is approximately   
$$
L_0 =1{.}9\cdot\frac{RT}{\fmu g}\Simeq15\;\km.   \eqMark{7_1_15}
$$
For an Earth observer the atmosphere can be considered flat with a good accuracy; even at the angle of $75\degree$ the width of the <<flat>> atmosphere differs from the true width by $1\%$ only. Therefore, the path at the angle $\theta$ is lengthened by 
$$
\Delta L=\frac{L_0}{\cos\ftheta}-L_0=L_0\left(\frac{1}{\cos\ftheta}-1\right).   \eqMark{7_1_16}
$$
The probability of decay on this additional way is 
$$
P(\Delta L)=1-e^{-\Delta L/L\sub{dec}}.   \eqMark{7_1_17}
$$
Here $L\sub{dec}=c\tau$ is the decay path, i.e. the distance at which the number of muons is reduced $e$-fold and $\tau$ is the lifetime of a moving muon. 

However one should take into account the additional absorption of muons at the angle $\theta$ because of ionization losses. Measurement of the vertical underground flux of muons at various depth shows that the number of muons $N(x)$ decreases with the depth $x~({\g/\cm^2})$ as 
$$
N(x)=\left({1000\over1000+x}\right)^{1.6}= \left({1000\over\xi}\right)^{1.6}\,,\eqMark{18}
$$
where $\xi=1000+x$ is the net amount of matter traversed by a muon from the point of creation to the point of absorption (the mass of a vertical air column is approximately 1000 g/cm$^2$). From geometry $\xi=1000/\cos\theta$. Thus the number of muons reaching the sea level decreases because of absorption in matter according to
$$
P_1(\theta)\propto (\cos\theta)^{1.6}\,.\eqMark{19}
$$

An increase of the muon path increases the probability of its decay. Therefore, the probability of passing the path $L$ without decay equals 
$$
P_2(\theta)=\exp\left(-{L(\theta)\over L}\right)\,,\eqMark{20}
$$ 
where $L=v\tau$ is the decay path, $v=\beta c$ is the muon velocity, and $\tau$ is the lifetime of moving muon. Since
$$
\tau={\tau_0\over\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}\,,\eqMark{21}
$$ 
where $\tau_0$ is the lifetime of muon at rest,
$$
L=\beta c{\tau_0\over\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}=\beta c\tau_0{E_\mu\over m_\mu c^2}\,,\eqMark{22}
$$ 
where $E_\mu=m_\mu c^2/\sqrt{1-\beta^2}$ is the total muon energy, $E_\mu$ can be taken as $4\cdot10^9$\,eV, and $m_\mu $=105.8\,MeV/$c^2$.

The ratio of the number of muons incident at the zentih angle $\theta$ to the number of muons coming directly from above can be written as
$$
{N(\theta)\over N(0^\circ)}={P_1(\theta)\over P_1(0^\circ)}\,{P_2(\theta)\over P_2(0^\circ)}=(\cos\theta)^{1.6}{e^{-L(\theta)/L}\over e^{-L_0/L}}\,,\eqMark{23}
$$
where  $P_1(\theta)$ and $P_2(\theta)$ are determined by Eqs.~(19) and~(20). The vertical muon path is $L_0=15$\,km, so the muon path at the angle $\theta$ is
$$
L(\theta)={L_0\over\cos\theta}\,.\eqMark{24}
$$

Using Eqs.~(\refEquation{22}) and (\refEquation{24}) and the experimental ratio $N(\theta)/N(0^\circ)$ one can estimate $\tau_0$ using Eq.~(\refEquation{23}). One should be aware that this calculation gives only the order of magnitude of $\tau_0$ because it does not take into account how the decay probability of muons changes when their energy decreases due to ionization losses.

\textbf{\so{Experimental installation}}\vspace{5pt}

In this experiment the angular distribution of cosmic rays is measured by means of two scintillation (or proportional) counters connected to a coincidence circuit\Footnotemark\Footnotetext{Operation principles of scintillation counter, PMT, and coincidence circuit are described in Appendices II--IV.} (see~\refFigure{7_1_1}).
%
\cFigure{Installation for measurement of angular distribution of hard component of cosmic rays}7_1_1 {8.8cm}{5cm}{pic/L07_1_01.eps}
%

The installation shown in~\refFigure{7_1_1} detects only the particles coming from the directions restricted by two dashed lines. Often the installation which detects particles coming from certain directions is called a telescope.
 
The coincidence circuit detects both true and accidental coincidence events. True events are caused by passage of a single particle through both counters that results in the appearance of simultaneous pulses at the inputs of coincidence circuit. Accidental coincidence is the appearance of pulses due to passage of different particles through the counters within the resolution time interval $\tau$. The number of accidental pulses per second is 
$$
N\sub{ac}=2\tau N_1N_{2},
\eqMark{7_1_25}
$$
where $N_1$ and $N_2$ are the number of pulses per second coming from a counter to the corresponding channel of the coincidence circuit.

The number of accidental pulses decreases as the resolution time of the circuit gets smaller. For this reason the resolution time is chosen as small as possible. The minimal resolution time is determined by the time of a particle flight between the upper and lower counters and by the instability of the counter response time. In our installation the most important is the time between the appearance of a scintillation and its detection, which is~($1\div2)\cdot 10^{-6}\;\s$.

\vspace{2ex}
\textbf{\so{Directions}}\vspace{5pt}

First of all one should determine the width of the lead shield which must be installed between the counters in order to cut off the soft component of cosmic rays.  

Without the shield the installation will detect both soft and hard components. The lead plates placed between the counters will absorb the particles of the soft component. At first the coincidence count rate noticeably decreases along with the number of plates installed, but at certain thickness the decrease becomes almost negligible meaning that only the hard component is detected. The dependence of the count rate $N$ on the shield thickness $x$ is called the {\it absorption curve}.

The absorption curve can be used to determine the intensity of soft $I\sub{s}$ and hard $I\sub{h}$ components. To do this one should extend the straight line corresponding to the hard component to its intersection with the ordinate. This gives $I\sub{h}$ (see~\refFigure{7_1_2}). The rest of the curve corresponds to $I\sub{s}$. Besides one should subtract the number of accidental coincidences from the net number of detected events. To do this one should measure the count rate of each counter (for about $15$\,min) and estimate the number of accidental events using Eq.~(\refEquation{7_1_25}).

One should be aware that the radiation coming from laboratory walls and interfloor bridging significantly distorts the resutls.

\vspace{10pt}

To measure the angular distribution of the hard component of cosmic rays install the lead filter between the counters. The filter thickness must be determined from the measured absorption curve.
%

%
Measure the angular distribution of the hard component $I$ with a $15\degree$ step, plot $\ln I$ versus $\cos\theta$, and determine the exponent $n$ in the equation 
$$
I=I_0\cos^n\theta\,.\eqMark{25}
$$
At the angles $\theta>50\;\degree$ one must correct the data by taking into account the showers originated in the laboratory walls and ceiling (the correction is measured at $\theta=90\degree$). 

Estimate the muon lifetime $\tau_0$ using the measured quantity $I(\theta)/I(0)$ (e.g. at $\theta=60\degree$).
