{Penetration of magnetic field in granular HTS}
{Temperature dependence of the London penetration depth for a ceramic HTS made of $\mathrm{YBaCuO}$ is measured. The measurement is based on dependence of the resonance frequency of an oscillator which inductor core is made of superconductor on temperature. The results allow one to estimate the effective value of the first critical magnetic field.}

Many pure metals (e.g. $\mathrm{Hg}$, $\mathrm{Pb}$, $\mathrm{Sn}$, $\mathrm{Al}$), alloys, and even organic compounds are superconductors. In $1986$ a new type of superconductive materials, metaloxides, was discovered. These materials are also known as \textit{high-$T_c$ superconductors} (HTS), since their critical temperature is around $100\;\kelvin$ ($T_{\mathrm c}$ of <<classical>> superconductors is less than $30\;\kelvin$). Any HTS is a Type~II superconductor. Nowadays the most common HTS are composed of $\mathrm{YBaCuO}$ and $\mathrm{BiSrCaCuO}$. In this experiment we study magnetic properties of these materials.

An experimental sample is obtained by caking the corresponding chemical components followed by annealing it in oxygen. The resulting ceramic alloy consists of superconductive granules. For this reason such HTS are called ceramic or granular. The typical size of a granule is about $10\;\mkm$. It should be mentioned that first experiments were done with granular samples; growing a single HTS crystal was a challenging task accomplished only later. A granular superconductor has interesting physical properties which are not possible even in principle in a classical low-$T_c$ superconductor. A granular superconductor is a disordered medium with weakly coupled granules; such a medium has very peculiar electrodynamic properties. <<Weak coupling>> in this context means that two superconductive granules are separated by a thin layer of oxide which is  dielectric. A Cooper pair can pass from a granule to another one only by tunneling through the barrier. In other words, the granules are separated by a Josephson junction, i.e. weakly coupled.

In this experiment the measurement of a penetration depth $\delta (T)$ versus temperature is done as follows. A copper coil is wound around an HTS core made of $\mathrm{YBa}_{2}\mathrm{Cu}_{3}\mathrm{O}_{7-x}$. The core is a ring $13\;\mm$ in external diameter, $8\;\mm$ in internal diameter, and $\Simeq 2{.}5\;\mm$ thick. The coil serves as the inductor coil of an $LC$-circuit included in a tunnel diode based generator assembled next to the HTS sample. The generator frequency is determined by the inductance as
$$
  \omega^{2}=\frac{1}{LC}.
  \eqMark{12_2_1}
$$

Since the penetration depth depends on temperature, the inductance depends on temperature as well, and so does the generator frequency. Thus measuring the temperature dependence of the generator frequency allows one to determine a temperature dependence of the penetration depth.

Actually, using this method one measures the depth of a skin layer rather than the London penetration depth in a material made of granules with different orientation. There are cavities between the granules which touch each other only at some points or lines of contact. Due to high degree of anisotropy of HTS crystals a high frequency current penetrates into a sample along some <<preferred>> directions of the crystals which size is comparable with $\lambda$. Thus, the penetration depth $\delta$ is obtained by averaging over the granules and reflects the HTS macrostructure rather than the property of its material. For this reason it is more appropriate to refer to $\delta$ as the length of magnetic field screening rather than the London penetration depth. Microscopically, it is the penetration depth in a three-dimensional random array of Josephson junctions between the crystal granules.

\textbf{\textso{Experimental installation}}

\vspace{4pt}
The installation is built around a low temperature cell housing a ring of $\mathrm{YBa}_{2}\mathrm{Cu}_{3}\mathrm{O}_{7-x}$ ceramic with a coil of copper wire wound around it, an oscillator  capacitor and a small capacitor which signal is applied to a frequency meter, a tunneling diode which is a part of autogenerator, and a carbon resistor serving as a thermometer. Its resistance is directly proportional to temperature in the range $75\div100\;\kelvin$ with a coefficient of proportionality $\alpha \Simeq 1{.}02\;\Om/\text{deg}$. To ensure a uniform temperature over the superconductive ring it is glued to a copper plate attached to the cell top. One end of the carbon cylinder is also soldered to the cell top. To reduce a temperature gradient along the cell it is made of brass, which has a high thermal conductivity, and covered with a brass cylinder. The external brass cylinder protects the generator elements from icing that usually drastically changes the generator parameters and can even result in mechanical rupture of the circuit.

A weak heat inflow is provided by a thin stainless steel tube on which the cell is suspended. The tube also serves as a casing for the lead wires ending up at an RF connector.

\textbf{\textso{Directions}}

\vspace{2pt}
Liquid nitrogen has a temperature below $-196\celsii$ and must be handled with care. A direct contact of liquid nitrogen with bare hands and face is strictly prohibited for it can lead to injury. Liquid nitrogen touching a warm surface (e.g. of a warm dewar or of the measurement cell) immediately evaporates and the vapor can throw the liquid quite far. Therefore pouring liquid  nitrogen and dipping something into it must be done slowly and carefully.

Measurement of a temperature dependence of the penetration depth is done by cooling the sample to the nitrogen boiling point and then by heating it according to the following procedure.

\begin{Enumerate}{tab}

\Item.
Assemble the measuring circuit, then turn on the frequency meter, the oscilloscope (for observing the generation), a thermometer ohmmeter, and the generator. By slowly adjusting the resistor in the upper part of the installation obtain a regular sinusoid on the screen.

\Item.
Fill about $1/2$ of a Dewar flask with liquid nitrogen by carefully pouring it from a storage dewar to prevent sloshing. 

\Item.
Cooling and heating must be done slowly over all temperature range to prevent large mechanical stress caused by temperature gradient and to maintain the system in thermal equilibrium. Cooling of the measurement cell is done by slowly descending it with the aid of a vernier in two steps. First, the cell is descended to the nitrogen surface only; after a while it can be immersed in the liquid completely. The immersion is easily controlled since the cell is clearly visible through transparent windows of the dewar. The resistance of carbon thermometer increases as the cell temperature decreases, and so does the generator frequency. One should keep recording the readings of thermometer and frequency meter starting with approximately $110\;\kelvin$.

\Item.
At the end of cooling make sure the cell is completely immersed since nitrogen keeps evaporating all time.

\Item.
Lift the cell slowly so that its bottom is about $5\;\mm$ above the surface.

\Item.
The cell temperature will gradually rise due to inflow of heat. One should keep recording the temperature and the generation frequency until the temperature reaches $100\;\kelvin$. If the heating is too slow the cell can be lifted $5\;\mm$ more.

\Item.
Plot the temperature dependence of the generation frequency and verify that at some temperature (critical temperature) the plot exhibits an irregularity. The measurement must be redone if it turns out that the dependencies obtained during cooling and heating are different: the system was not in thermal equilibrium. Only after that lift the cell from the dewar.

\textbf{\textso{Treatment of results}}

\vspace{2pt}
\begin{Enumerate}{tab}
\Item.
Plot the generator frequency versus temperature and determine graphically the critical temperature. Assume that the minimal temperature is equal to the nitrogen boiling point ($77\;\kelvin$), a higher temperature is determined by the readings of carbon thermometer.

% 
Using Eq.~(\refEquation{12_25}) estimate the energy gap of the sample of $\mathrm{YBaCuO}$ at zero temperature.

\Item.
Parameters of the oscillator circuit vary with temperature, hence the generator frequency changes too. This temperature dependence is clearly visible in the region above the critical temperature. Extrapolate this region linearly to the whole measurement range and evaluate the dependence $\omega_{0}(T)$ of the generator with an <<empty>> ring.

\Item.
Plot the temperature dependence of the penetration depth $\delta$ using the results which should be treated as follows. The coil inductance is proportional to the area occupied by magnetic flux. Let the coil cross-sectional dimensions be $a_{0}$ and $b_{0}$, the superconductor dimensions be $a$ and $b$, and the penetration depth be $\delta$. Then according to the diagram in~\refFigure{12_2_2},
$$
  L=A[a_{0} b_{0}-(a-2\delta ) (b-2\delta)],
  \eqMark{12_2_2}
$$
where $A$~is a proportionality factor.

According to~Eq.~(\refEquation{12_2_2}),
$$
  \frac{1}{\fomega^{2} (T)} -\frac{1}{\fomega^{2}(0)} =CA[2(a+b) ( \delta (T) - \delta(0))],
  \eqMark{12_2_3}
$$
where $\omega (0)$~is the oscillator frequency at zero temperature. The superconductivity does not affect the frequency at $T>T_{\mathrm c}$ and, as it has been already shown, the temperature dependence of the frequency $\widetilde{\omega}$ of <<empty>> oscillator circuit can be determined in this region,
$$
  \frac{1}{\widetilde{\fomega}^{2}}=CAa_{0}b_{0}.
  \eqMark{12_2_4}
$$

Thus,
$$
  \Delta \delta (T) = \delta (T) - \delta (0) = \frac{a_{0} b_{0}}{2(a+b)}\frac{1/\fomega^{2}(T)-1/\fomega_{0}^{2}}{1/\widetilde {\fomega}^{2}}.
  \eqMark{12_2_5}
$$

In this installation $a_{0}\Simeq a=2\;\mm$ and $b_{0}\Simeq b=2{.}5\;\mm$; since the coil winding is made of a very thin wire,
$$
  \Delta \delta (T) =\frac{1}{2}\frac{1/\fomega^{2}(T) -1/\fomega_{0}^{2}}{1/\widetilde {\fomega}^{2}}\;\mm.
  \eqMark{12_2_6}
$$

It has already been discussed that in <<ordinary>> superconductor and in single crystal of HTS the temperature dependence of the London penetration depth is described by Eq.~(\refEquation{12_29}). This a linear function of a parameter $Y_{T} =[1-(T/T_{\mathrm c})^{4}]^{-1/2}$ which is called the reduced Gorter-Casimir temperature. Thus, $\lambda (T) = \lambda (0) Y_{T}$. The dependence $\Delta \delta (T)$ must be plotted as a function of this parameter. The slope of this function near the value of $Y_{T}$ equal to unity (close to the nitrogen boiling point) determines the value of $\delta (0)$. Estimate the temperature corresponding to the penetration depth equal to the ring cross-section ($\Simeq 1{.}25\;\mm$).

\Item.
Using the results estimate the first critical magnetic field $\widetilde {H}_{\mathrm c1}$ for the ceramic sample at zero temperature. Assume that the value of $\delta$ obtained equals the London depth given by Eq.~(\refEquation{12_7}); actually in this case we are not dealing with Abrikosov vortices but with Josephson ones penetrating through <<weak spots>> of the material. 
Estimate $\widetilde {H}_{\mathrm c1}$ at the nitrogen boiling point and at the temperature two degrees below the critical temperature.
